Get the source from Google code:
svn checkout https://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delphi-museum-project 
  --username <your gmail id (everything before the @gmail.com)>

Download a development tool, e.g., EasyEclipse Desktop dev:
http://easyeclipse.org/site/distributions/desktop-java.html

Open tool, set up workspace (e.g., under tools), create a project.
In EasyEcplise, do File->New->Project, then select Java Project (under "Java"). 
Click Next, and then select Create Project in workspace, and then type in DelphiImporter.
This will use the existing source (assuming you set up workspace under tools) for
the project.

Now you should be able to build and go.
