<h3>Welcome to the Delphi Faceted Browser</h3>
<p>Facets are an increasingly popular way to organize objects in a collection and to
help a user to learn "what's there." We believe that they provide a superior
experience of exploring and searching through diverse collections and help the
visitor notice categories and relationships between objects that may not have been
obvious otherwise. Please read this Help to learn about and begin using the
Delphi Faceted Browser.</p>
<h3>What is a facet?</h3>
<p> 
A facet is a set of attributes that describe an object. Every item in the collection
can have a variety of attributes associated with it, depending upon how much is known
about the object. For example, a cup could have a <b>Material</b> facet (plastic,
metal, glass), a <b>Site or Provenience</b> facet (where it was found or made),
a <b>Technique</b> facet (how it was made), and a few other facets that describe it.</p>
<p>
Here are the examples of some other facets a user may find in our Delphi
Faceted Browser:<br />
Example: A <b>Japanese sword</b> is described by the following facets:
"Use or Context," "Site or Provenience," "Material," "Technique, Design or Decoration,"
and "Color."
</p>
<h3>Working with the Delphi Faceted Browser.</h3>
<p>
How can a user find an item that has several properties which are described by
different categories? Begin by exploring any facet, such as "Material" or
"Use or Context." It does not matter in which order a user proceeds, because she will always
arrive at the same destination by exploring the same facets in different order. We present
the results of each step of a search on the right side of the browser screen,
while helping users to explore, mark, expand, or narrow down the categories in the Faceted
Browser on the left side of the screen. 
</p>

<p><b>Select a first facet.</b> Let's begin with the "Material" facet.
Click onto the <b> plus sign</b> next to the "Material" facet link on
the left side of the screen. A list of possible categories that describe materials will
be presented. Select any of the facets inside of the "Material," such as "metal," by clicking
on it in order to apply it to the search results. The font of the selected facet
will become bold. A user will also see that a selection of items in the results area
got smaller and the only remaining items are those that have their "Material" facet equal
to "metal." 
</p>
<p>
<b>Select any other facet.</b> For example, in order to narrow down these results to
a specific color, such as red, click on "Red." Voila! The only remaining items in
the results section are those that match all of the criteria ("Material" is "metal"
and the "Color" is "red") that have been selected by exploring and clicking on
to the Delphi Faceted Browser facets on the left. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Modifying search results.</b> A user can select any number of other facets. All he has to
do in order to modify his search is to either check or un-check some
of the facets by clicking on the small cross icon next to the selected facets
listed at the top of the page. Selecting more facets will further constrain search results,
while un-checking the facets will enlarge the number of results.
</p>

<h3>Dynamically changing browser view.</h3>
<p>The Delphi Faceted Browser will only show the categories that are relevant to the
part of the set of the collection objects that you are recurrently viewing. The Browser
will <em>hide</em> facets that are not relevant to the items shown in the results area
on your right. This makes the browsing experience more visually streamlined
and simplifies navigation.
</p>

<h3>Collection objects without images</h3>
<p>
The Hearst Museum has many items in their collection which do not (yet) have images
associated with them. The users can still browse through all of the collection records
by selecting the "Include Items without Images"
option on the right top portion of the screen, in the area just
above the results set. 
</p>

<p>
We hope that you will have fun and find many interesting items while exploring the Museum's collections! 
</p>

Thank you,
