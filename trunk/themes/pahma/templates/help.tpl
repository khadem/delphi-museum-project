<h2>Welcome to the Delphi Collections Browser</h2>
<p>The Delphi faceted browser provides a simple way to navigate through museum
collections. The browser view changes dynamically to show only concepts
relevant to the area of the collection that is being explored. This makes the
browsing experience more visually streamlined and helps the visitor discover
concepts and relationships between objects that may not otherwise be obvious.
Clicking on any concept refines the search. The concept listing on the left is
derived automatically from an underlying ontology that organizes concepts
associated with the collections into distinct <em>facets</em> such as location,
culture, materials, etc.</p>
<h3>What is a facet?</h3>
<p> 
A facet is a set of attributes that describe an object from a distinct
and independent perspective. A Location facet, for example, describes
all the places associated with objects in the collections, and organizes
these places for easy understanding.&nbsp; The PAHMA collections are
described using facets that address the general questions of&nbsp;'who?'
(<strong>Culture</strong>), 'what?' (<strong>Object Name</strong>,
<strong>Materials</strong>, and <strong>Collection</strong>), 'where?'
(<strong>Location</strong>), 'why?' (<strong>Activity or
Context</strong>) and 'how?' (<strong>Technique, Design or
Decoration</strong>, and <strong>Color</strong>).&nbsp;
Separating these from one another simplifies the overall structure and
makes it easier and more powerful to use for searching and browsing.</p>
<h3>Where to begin?</h3>
<p>There are several ways to use the Delphi browser, depending on the task at
hand. You can dive right in, enter a basic keyword search, or browse the full
set of concepts that describe the collections. 
</p>

<p>If you just want to browse some interesting objects, you can click on any of
the objects or featured sets on the home page. These will dive right into the
collections and let you explore. 
</p>

<p>If you have a particular topic in mind, you can type a keyword (or keywords)
into the search box that is in the banner of every page (use quotes to specify
an exact phrase). This will search the collections for names and descriptions
that include the keyword(s) you enter. Delphi will then display the results and
also show you the concepts in each facet, that apply to the results of your
search. You can click on any concept in the facet listing to refine your
search. The numbers after each concept indicate how many objects you will see
if you refine the search with that concept, and so can give you a quick
overview of how the results are distributed by location, culture, etc.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>If you want to explore the collections by topic, click on the
&quot;Browse&quot; link in the banner and you can explore the full ontology,
facet by facet. Clicking on the plus icon to the left of a concept will expand
to show sub-concepts. As on the results page, numbers after each concept
indicate how many objects are associated with that concept. Clicking on any
concept will search the collections for all objects associated with that
concept. 
</p>

<p>Click on the image or name for any object on the results page to see the
details for that object. 
</p>

<h3>Viewing object details</h3>
<p>When you are on the details page for any object, you will see a larger image
(for those objects that have images), and more information about the object.
Click on the image to zoom in and explore the details of the object. If there
are multiple views, this will be indicated below the zoom window, and you can
click on any of these to switch views for zooming.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>The details view also lists all the concepts, by facet, associated with
that object. - you can click on any of these to &quot;pivot&quot;, or explore
the collections on that subject. 
</p>

<p>The details page lets you add an object to a <em>set</em>, allowing you to
build your own personal collections. These may be themed, or may just be favorite
objects you've come across - it's up to you. If you want, you can even set your
own name and notes for each object to create a story, and then share your sets
with your friends. 
</p>

<p>If you want to add your own descriptive keywords to an object, click the Tags
button and then add yours. If you want to add more than one, enter them one at a
time.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h3>Collections objects without images</h3>
<p>
The Hearst Museum collections include many items that do not (yet) have images
associated with them. The users can still browse through all of the collection records
by selecting the "Include Items without Images"
option. 
</p>
