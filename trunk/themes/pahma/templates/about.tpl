===About Delphi Project===

<p><a href="://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi"> Delphi</a> is a web-based collections browser created in 2007 by the students from the  <a href="://ischool.berkeley.edu"> UC Berkeley School of Information</a> for the <a href="://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/"> Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology</a> at the <a href="://berkeley.edu/"> University of California, Berkeley</a>. The Museum's collections span the world and document several thousand years of human culture and prehistory, yet only a tiny fraction of the artifacts are exhibited due to limited Museum space. The Museum's current collections management system contains roughly 620,000 records, which represent nearly all of the approximately 2 to 3 million objects in their collections. About 50,000 of these records have high-resolution images associated with them, and new images are added at the rate of a few thousand each month. 
</p>
<p>
The main goals of the <a href="://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi"> Delphi</a> project were to expose the vast collection on the web which is not limited by physical size constraints and to make its contents more accessible to researchers, educators, and general public, while protecting the Museum's ownership rights over the images. In addition to increasing the visibility of the Museum to a much larger audience, we also wanted to emphasize the breadth of their collection which encompasses a wide range of objects: from an ancient Egyptian sculpture from Giza to Japanese swords to century-old photos of Native Californians. 

</p>
<p><a href="://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi"> Delphi</a> can be used by researchers, students, and educators, though we decided to design our system to accomodate the needs of the general public, which the Museum wants to attract.  
</p>
<p>
Searching and browsing functionality could be used to explore the collections. The <a href="://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi"> Delphi</a> <a href="://jonlesser.net/wiki/index.php?title=Help"> Faceted Browser</a> is based on an ontology designed from the metadata in the Museumâ€™s current content management system. <a href="://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi"> Delphi</a> uses text-mining to associate ontology concepts with collections objects. Please read our <a href="://help.html"> <b>EDIT LINK!!!</b>Help</a> section to learn to browse and search the ontologies of objects presented by <a href="://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi"> Delphi</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi"> Delphi</a> user interface presents each object with descriptive metadata extracted from the Museum's database and a zoom-and-pan explorer of high-resolution images. It supports user-annotation of the collections where visitors can 1) tag and comment objects, 2) create and organize sets of objects of interest, and 3) share their annotations and sets with others.
