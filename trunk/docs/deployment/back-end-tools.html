<h1>Deploying Delphi: Back-end Tools</h1>The Delphi Project incorporates a set of back-end tools for processing and analyzing data about the artifacts in the
collection, and to load this data into a data repository.<br /><br />These tools are used to carry out the following processes:<br /><br /><ol><li>Retrieving data from the collection(s).<br /><br /></li><li>Cleaning up the data.<br /><br /></li><li>Merging data (where required).<br /><br /></li><li>...<br /><br /></li></ol><h2>1. Retrieving data from the collections</h2>To
kick-off the set of back-end processes, Delphi's back-end tools need to
retrieve data ("metadata") about the artifacts in the collection, in a
format suitable for further processing.<br /><br />The
following notes are specific to the instance of Delphi for the Phoebe
A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA) at the University of
California, Berkeley. Similar procedures would need to be carried out
for collections at other museums or similar institutions.<br /><br />PAHMA stores data about the artifacts in its collections in a content management system, <a href="http://www.gallerysystems.com/products/tms.html" target="_blank">The Museum System (TMS)</a>
by Gallery Systems. &nbsp;TMS uses Microsoft SQL Server as a back-end
relational database management system. &nbsp;At one point in the past,
PAHMA staff determined which of the approximately 250 database tables
used by TMS have pertinent data about their artifacts. &nbsp;Via SQL
queries, they periodically extract that data into comma-separated value
(CSV) files, in order to make this data available to Delphi.<br /><br />Periodically,
Delphi's administrators physically visit PAHMA to acquire PAHMA's
latest extracts from the TMS database, placing them on a memory stick
or similar portable drive. &nbsp;Beginning in Fall 2008, Delphi's
administrators have been working with PAHMA staff to determine whether
it is feasible for Delphi to perform the same SQL queries directly
against the TMS database over the campus network. &nbsp;This could
obviate the need for physical visits, making it possible to both
automate some of the back-end processing workflows and to perform them
more frequently.<br /><br />As of Fall 2008, &nbsp;the entire database
extract - about 1 million database table rows, representing some 600
million artifacts in the collection, and requiring about 250 MB of disk
space (uncompressed) or 30 MB (compressed) &#8211; is processed each time.
&nbsp;A future goal of the Delphi Project is to make it possible to
identify just what has changed between successive processing runs &#8211;
additions, changes, and deletions &#8211; and process just that data.<br /><br />Other notes:<br /><br />TMS
was designed for art collections, not anthropology collections.
&nbsp;As a result, there are some ideosyncracies in the way that data
is stored in TMS's database tables that need to be worked around.
&nbsp;For instance, with artwork, typically the location field is used
to specify where the artifact is currently located. &nbsp;With
anthropology collections, a second location value also needs to be
provided, identifying the setting in which the artifact was originally
found.<br /><br />Also, because of some programming quirks in TMS,
pertinent data may be stored in any number of tables and fields.
&nbsp;For instance, there are six possible places where location data
for an artifact may be stored.<br /><br />Possibly-related rough notes, not understood on re-reading:<br /><br />If all new CU items to obj not uniformly across DB.<br /><h2>2. Cleaning up the data</h2>The data that comes in <br /><br /><h2>3. Merging data (where required)</h2></body></html>
