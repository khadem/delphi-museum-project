<h1>Deploying Delphi: Back-end Tools</h1>
The Delphi Project incorporates a set of back-end tools for processing
and analyzing data about the artifacts in the
collection, and to load this data into a data repository.<br />
<br />
The
goal of this processing and analysis is to build a "semantic index,"
which associates a set of concepts from a mental model ("ontology")
with each artifact. &nbsp;That way, the collection can be searched
or
browsed by these concepts - such as culture, use or context, material,
and design - in addition to the data ("metadata") already available for
the artifact.<br />
<br />
These back-end tools are used to carry out the following processes, all
of which are necessary to build the semantic index: &nbsp;*THIS IS
A
PLACEHOLDER AND ONLY PARTLY ACCURATE LIST*<br />
<ol>
<li>Retrieving data ("metadata") from the collection(s).<br />

<li>Cleaning up the data.<br />

<li>Merging data.<br />
<br />

<li>Building and maintaining the mental model ("ontology").<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Associating concepts from that model with each artifact.</li>
</ol>
<p>The
following notes are specific to the instance of Delphi for the Phoebe
A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA) at the University of
California, Berkeley. However, highly similar procedures would need to
be carried out with new instances of Delphi that may be applied to
collections at other institutions.</p>
<h2>1. Retrieving data from the collections</h2>
To kick-off its set of back-end processes, Delphi's back-end tools need
to first retrieve data ("metadata") from PAHMA about the artifacts in
the collection.<br />
<br />
PAHMA stores data about the artifacts in its collections in a content
management system, <a href="http://www.gallerysystems.com/products/tms.html" target="_blank">The Museum System</a> (TMS) by Gallery
Systems (http://www.gallerysystems.com/products/tms.html).
&nbsp;TMS uses Microsoft SQL Server as a back-end
relational database management system.<br />
<br />
At one point in the
past, PAHMA staff determined which of the approximately 250 database
tables used by TMS have pertinent data about their artifacts.
&nbsp;Via SQL queries, they periodically extract that data into
comma-separated value (CSV) files, in order to make this data available
to Delphi. &nbsp;These CSV files are structured as a set of named
columns, each
containing text annotations about the artifacts.<br />
<br />
On certain occasions, Delphi's administrators physically visit PAHMA to
acquire
PAHMA's latest extracts from the TMS database, placing them on a memory
stick or similar portable drive.<br />
<br />
As of Fall 2008, &nbsp;the entire database extract - about 1
million database table rows, representing some 600 million artifacts in
the collection, and requiring about 250 MB of disk space (uncompressed)
or 30 MB (compressed) &#8211; is processed each time.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Notes regarding possible
future enhancements:</span><br />
<br style="font-style: italic;" />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Directly access database
data from PAHMA</span>. &nbsp;Beginning in Fall 2008,
Delphi's administrators have been working with PAHMA staff to determine
whether it is feasible for Delphi to perform the same SQL queries
directly against the TMS database over the campus network.
&nbsp;This could obviate the need for physical visits, making it
possible to both automate some of the back-end processing workflows and
to perform them more frequently.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Create a data warehouse</span>.
&nbsp;In addition, IST's MySQL Basic service allows the creation of
multiple databases. &nbsp;This may make it feasible to set up a
"data warehouse," a database dedicated to storing newly-received data
from PAHMA, and replace the current practice of storing and
manipulating text extracts from PAHMA's TMS databases. &nbsp;Future
back-end tools could directly extract data from the data warehouse, in
more automated workflows that could then selectively update the data in
Delphi's production database.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Process only updated
data, rather than all data at once</span>. &nbsp;A future
goal
of the Delphi Project is to make it possible to identify just what has
changed between successive processing runs &#8211; additions, changes, and
deletions taking place after the previous run &#8211; and process just that
data. A data warehouse or, barring that, some other changes in
practices, might make that more feasible.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Other notes</span>:<br />
<br />
TMS was designed for art collections, not anthropology collections.
&nbsp;As a result, there are some ideosyncracies in the way that
data is stored in TMS's database tables that need to be worked around.
&nbsp;For instance, with artwork, typically the location field is
used to specify where the artifact is currently located. &nbsp;With
anthropology collections, a second location value also needs to be
provided, identifying the setting in which the artifact was originally
found.<br />
<br />
Also, because of some programming quirks in TMS, pertinent data may be
stored in any number of tables and fields. &nbsp;For instance,
there are six possible places where location data for an artifact may
be stored.<br />

<h2>2. Cleaning up the data</h2>
The data that comes in from PAHMA requires some cleanup before it can
be provided for public access via Delphi's collections browser.
<br />
<br />
(Background - may not be necessary to discuss this here ...) The
characteristics of this data vary throughout the
collections, making this cleanup necessary. &nbsp;Annotations about
the objects in PAHMA's collections have been made by many different
people, over a period of more than a century, and in recent years some
of this data was imported from a variety of data repositories, each
with their own ideosyncracies.<br />
<br />
There are several types of&nbsp;problematic data that must be
cleaned:
<ul>
<li>Noise data.<br />
<br />
Generally this is internal data, of interest primarily to institutional
staff, rather than to the public. &nbsp;While
valuable in its own right, this data does not describe the
characteristics of an artifact and therefore is not
useful in associating concepts with that artifact.<br />
<br />
Examples
include notations about an artifact having been examined by a
particular anthropologist or other expert, or reviewed by a committee.
&nbsp;Attribution notes, tracking notes or notations for accounting
review are other representative examples.<br />
<br />
Noise data is generally removed outright ("elided"), in a process
generically termed "noise reduction."<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Confidential or sensitive data.<br />
<br />
This includes prices paid for objects, detailed storage locations and
donor names.<br />
<br />
Confidential or sensitive data is generally either obfuscated or
anonymized - for instance, prices are
obfuscated with placeholder values like&nbsp;<code>$##.##</code> or&nbsp;<code>&#8364;##.##</code> - so that
sentence structures can remain intact.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Problematic character data.<br />
<br />
Characters pasted in from Word, for instance, that are in various
character sets. &nbsp;'Smart' (curly) quote marks, em- and
en-dashes, and ... &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Problematic character data is generally encoded as XML entities.
&nbsp;*VERIFY THIS*<br />
<br />
(Placeholder)
Note that some XML entities need to be further transformed within PHP,
when preparing data for output on web pages, to avoid various display
issues.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performing the cleanup</h3>
This cleanup is currently performed
using one or more 'sed' scripts on Patrick's workstation. &nbsp;sed
is
a text processing tool that includes the ability to use regular
expressions patterns to transform text. &nbsp;It comes standard
with
Unix-like systems&nbsp;, and is available for other operating
systems.
&nbsp;For more background on sed, please see this&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article</a> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed).<br />
<br />
Most
of the processing performed by these scripts uses either of two
types of regular expression rules: finding and replacing text, or
deleting any text if a match is found (as is done with noise data).
&nbsp;These rules have been commented, both to describe their
purpose
and to summarize what text substitutions or deletions they are
performing.<br />
<br />
Due to the
potential sensitivity of their contents, these sed scripts are not
currently managed under version control, nor are there copies in the
'pahma' account on the IST Unix Web Farm.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">To do note</span>:
At Patrick's suggestion, Aron will look into whether these scripts
might be
securely stored in the Subversion repository associated with that IST
Unix Web Farm account. &nbsp;Although that repository is primarily
intended for migrations between Web Farm tiers, it could also be used
for an auxiliary purpose like this.
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Notes regarding possible
future enhancements:</span><br />
<br />
Use a rules processing engine, along with a configuration
file:&nbsp; Patrick Schmitz has suggested that the cleanup process
could be made more general and configurable <br />
<br />
http://code.google.com/p/delphi-museum-project/wiki/DataImportNotes<br />
<br />
Question to self: Does the cleanup process also involve tokenizing the
data, or is this a separate step? &nbsp;See Patrick's
"Documentation Needs" notes.<br />
