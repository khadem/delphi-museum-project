<h1>Deploying Delphi: Introduction</h1>
<div class="draftnote">
<p>This is a draft page, in ongoing development. It is still
rough, but we are exposing it to the community
for review and to help anyone considering a Delphi deployment. We are
actively updating all of the documentation, so it is best to use this
resource online, rather than printing out a version.</p>
</div>

<p>
This is an introduction to and overview of the deployment of Delphi, an open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions. &nbsp;Delphi uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.</p>
<p>
To learn more about Delphi, see <a href="../bibliography.html">Delphi

Bibliography</a>.
</p>
<p>
This deployment overview serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To document the current prototype instance of Delphi, in
production use at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>To make it easier to deploy and run your own instance of
Delphi, at an institution other than PAHMA.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment components</h2>
<p>There are three major components to the current Delphi
deployment used by the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley. &nbsp;These
components, along with their associated
sub-components, will also be present in any
highly similar instances of Delphi that are deployed and run outside
PAHMA:</p>
<strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>T</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">he Delphi "collections browser,"</span>
a web-based application, allows virtual museum visitors to explore
the museum's collections over
the Internet.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>A data repository</strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> stores the data that
is&nbsp;accessed by the collections browser.<br />
<br />
This includes </span>data about the
artifacts in the collections ("metadata"), plus a "semantic index"
containing the associations between each artifact and the set of
concepts that pertain to it.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Back-end tools</strong>
process the data obtained from the museum, and load the data into the
data repository.<br />
</li>
</ul>
More detail about each of these three major components follows:
<h3>Collections browser<br />
</h3>
<p>The Delphi "collections browser," a web-based
application,&nbsp;allows virtual museum visitors to explore the
museum's collections over
the web.&nbsp; Visitors can search for artifacts, via both concepts
and keywords, and can interactively browse their various "facets" (e.g.
location, culture, materials).</p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Decide
whether, and if so how, to introduce the personal annotation and
community curation aspects of Delphi here.</span></p>
<p>The collections browser currently runs
in the Apache Web Server and at its core consists of PHP-driven content
and template files, supported by a combination of PHP libraries; JavaScript code and
libraries; CSS style sheets, and a Flash-based tool to allow users to
zoom-and-pan through images.<br />
</p>
<p>To learn more about the collections browser, see <a href="collections-browser.html">Deploying Delphi:
Collections Browser</a>.</p>
<h3>Data repository</h3>
<p>The data repository contains the data that is accessed by the
collections browser. &nbsp;This data is also sometimes used for
reporting and other
purposes.<br />
<br />
Currently, the data repository is a MySQL relational
database. &nbsp;Delphi is also capable of using other relational
database software, and in the future, potentially may be able to use a
"triple store" (a database-like repository for storing semantic data). <br />
<br />
The data repository stores two types of data:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Data about
artifacts in the collections ("metadata").<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>This data comes directly from
the museum or other heritage institution. &nbsp;It is displayed when
the Delphi collections browser
provides details about individual artifacts. &nbsp;In
addition, this data is "mined," to
help build a set of concepts that more fully describe the collection
and then to associate those concepts with each of the individual
artifacts in the collections.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Data about the concepts associated with these artifacts (a
"semantic index").<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>This data is generated by Delphi's back-end tools. &nbsp;It helps users of Delphi's collections browser locate
artifacts by concepts, as well as to uncover relationships between artifacts.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
To learn more about the data repository, see <a href="data-repository.html">Deploying Delphi: Data Repository</a>.
<h3>Back-end tools</h3>A set of back-end tools are used to take the data received from
PAHMA, process that data, and load it into the data repository.<br />
<p>There are currently two back-end tools:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>A 'sed' script for initial cleanup of the data.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>A Java-based, menu-driven application for further processing of the
cleaned
data.<br />
<br />This application makes it possible to perform a set of diverse tasks
related to text analysis and semantic
indexing. &nbsp;The ultimate result of performing all of these tasks is that
the data repository is populated with data that can be used by the
collections browser. &nbsp;This data includes metadata about artifacts in
the collection, and a semantic index of the concepts associated with
each artifact.<span class="comment highlight"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, both of these tools are used manually, in batch mode. &nbsp;After
the initial data cleanup, it is then necessary to perform a set of tasks in a specific sequence, using
the Java-based application, in order to process the data and load it into the data repository.&nbsp;
Future Delphi enhancements
may help automate some of this back-end work.<span class="comment highlight"></span></p>

<h2>Other Delphi
components</h2>
<p>In addition to the
three deployment-related components listed
above, there are two closely-related support components of the Delphi
project:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The code
repository
for the project</span>,
where its source code, templates,
configuration
files, libraries, and other files are stored, and its issues are
tracked.<br />
<br />
For more information about the code repository, see <a href="../code-repository.html">Delphi: Code Repository</a>.<br />
<br />

of the hierarchical organization of the code and other artifacts for
the Delphi project, see <a href="../code-layout.html">Delphi:
