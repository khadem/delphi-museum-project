<h1>Deploying Delphi: Introduction</h1>
<div class="draftnote">
<p>This is a draft page, in ongoing development. It is still rough, but we are exposing it to the community
for review and to help anyone considering a Delphi deployment. We are actively updating all of the documentation, 
so it is best to use this resource online, rather than printing out a version.</p>
</div>
<p>
This is an overview of the deployment of Delphi, an open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions.</p>
<p>
Delphi uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.</p>
<p>
To learn more about Delphi, see Delphi: Bibliography (TBD).
</p>
<p>
This deployment overview serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To document the current prototype instance of Delphi, in
production use at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>To make it easier to deploy and run your own instance of
Delphi, at an institution other than PAHMA.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment components</h2>
<p>Delphi has three major components:<br /></p><ol><li>
<strong>T</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">he Delphi "collections browser,"</span>
a web-based application that allows virtual museum visitors to explore
the museum's collections over
the Internet. &nbsp;Visitors can browse and search the collections
using concepts such as culture and materials, as well as using
traditional search terms.<br /></li><li>
<strong>A data repository</strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> is accessed by the collections browser. &nbsp;This repository stores </span>the
data about the
artifacts in the collections ("metadata"), as well as a semantic index
containing the associations between each artifact and the set of
concepts that pertain to it.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>A set of back-end tools </strong>build and maintain the data in the data repository. &nbsp;Thereafter, that data is accessed directly by the collections browser.</li></ol><h2>Collections browser<br /></h2><p>The
Delphi collections browser is supported by PHP libraries and PHP-driven
content and template files. &nbsp;It also accesses data in a repository
- a MySQL database - whose contents are maintained using a set of
back-end tools.<br /><br />To learn more about the collections browser and its sub-components, see <a href="components.html">Deploying Delphi: Components</a>. &nbsp;(Change this to Deploying Delphi: Collections browser.)</p><h2>Data repository</h2>
...<br /><br />To learn more about the data repository, see ...<h2>Back-end tools</h2>
<p>A Java application provides support for text analysis, semantic
indexing, and related support to build and maintain the database that
supports the online browser. &nbsp;A 'sed' script is also used to
perform some initial data cleanup, required before this set of
processes can take place.<br /><br />To learn more about these back-end tools, see <a href="back-end-tools.html">Deploying 
Delphi: Back-end Tools.<br /><br /></a><br /><a href="back-end-tools.html"></a></p>
