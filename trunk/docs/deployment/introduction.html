<h1>Deploying Delphi: Introduction</h1>
<div class="draftnote">
<p>This is a draft page, in ongoing development. It is still rough, but we are exposing it to the community
for review and to help anyone considering a Delphi deployment. We are actively updating all of the documentation, 
so it is best to use this resource online, rather than printing out a version.</p>
</div>
<p>
This is an overview of the deployment of Delphi, an open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions.</p>
<p>
Delphi uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.</p>
<p>
To learn more about Delphi, see Delphi: Bibliography (TBD).
</p>
<p>
This deployment overview serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To document the current prototype instance of Delphi, in
production use at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>To make it easier to deploy and run your own instance of
Delphi, at an institution other than PAHMA.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment components</h2>
<p>A Delphi collections browser is supported by a database, some PHP libraries 
and PHP-driven content and template files. To learn more about the browser 
support, see <a href="components.html">Deploying Delphi: Components</a>.</p>
<h2>Back end tools</h2>
<p>A java application provides support for text analysis, semantic indexing, and 
related support to build and maintain the database that supports the online 
browser. To learn more about this, see <a href="back-end-tools.html">Deploying 
Delphi: Back-end Tools.</a></p>
