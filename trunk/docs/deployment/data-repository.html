<h1>Deploying Delphi: Data Repository</h1>
<div class="draftnote">
<p>This is a draft page, in ongoing development. It is still
rough, but we are exposing it to the community
for review and to help anyone considering a Delphi deployment. We are
actively updating all of the documentation, so it is best to use this
resource online, rather than printing out a version.</p>
</div>
<p>
This is an overview of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">data repository</span> in Delphi, an
open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions. &nbsp;Delphi uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.
</p>
<h2>Types of data stored in the repository<br />
</h2>
The data repository stores two types of data:
<ul>
<li>Data about
artifacts in the collections ("metadata").<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Purposes of this data</span>:
&nbsp;This data is displayed when the Delphi collections browser
provides details about individual artifacts.<br />
<br />
In
addition, this data is "mined," via natural language processing, to
help build a set of concepts that more fully describe the collection
and then to associate those concepts with each of the individual
artifacts in the collections.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Source of this data</span>:
&nbsp;In the instance of Delphi used by PAHMA, data about the
artifacts in its collections ("metadata") comes
directly from that museum.<br />
<br />
Future instances of Delphi deployed elsewhere will similarly obtain
this metadata from their own museums or heritage
institutions. &nbsp;In each of those instances, the format of this
metadata will vary. &nbsp;This format depends both on how any
specific institution organizes the metadata about its collections, and
potentially also on the collections management system it uses to store
that data.<br />
<br />
As a result, the code and/or configuration of Delphi's back-end tools,
which load this metadata into the data repository, will need to be
customized for each instance. &nbsp;However, the database schemas
used to store this metadata in Delphi are relatively generic, and might
not need to be changed, or require only minor changes.<br />
<br />
<span class="comment highlight">Verify this - would
this assertion apply if Delphi were used for an art museum, for
instance? &nbsp;Also, consider moving the paragraph just above
elsewhere; this may not be its most appropriate location.</span><br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Data about the concepts associated with these artifacts (a
"semantic index").<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Purpose of this data</span>:
&nbsp;This data helps users of Delphi's collections browser locate
artifacts by concepts, and help uncover relationships between artifacts.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Source of this data</span>:
This data is generated by Delphi's back-end tools (below), based on the
data provided by the museum.<br />
<br />
Future instances of
Delphi deployed elsewhere will need to build their own mental models
("ontologies") of their data facets and concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Components</h2>
The data repository currently consists of the following components:
<h3><strong>1. MySQL</strong></h3>
<p>The data repository for the instance of Delphi currently used
by PAHMA
is MySQL, an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).
&nbsp;MySQL is available in two flavors - MySQL Community Server
(free), and MySQL Enterprise (commercial, packaged with an enhanced set
of support services).<br />
<br /><em>Obtained from</em>: <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/</a></p><p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance:</em> &nbsp;5.0.67 &nbsp;(The installed version is under the control of IST's&nbsp;</p><p>
<em>Latest version (stable)</em>: 5.0.67</p><p><span class="comment highlight">Add details about licensing, etc. here.</span></p><p><em></em>
Delphi can also potentially use other relational
database software in place of MySQL. &nbsp;This is because Delphi's
PHP-based code makes generic database calls via a PHP library,
Pear::MDB2, that supports a number of different types of databases.<br />
<br />
The Delphi team had considered other types of
data repositories, such as a "triple store" that is optimized for
storing
and retrieving semantic data represented via the Resource Description
Framework (RDF), but chose a relational database primarily on the basis
of
performance.&nbsp;<span class="comment highlight"><br /></span> </p>
<h3><strong>2. phpMyAdmin</strong></h3>
<p>phpMyAdmin is an open source administration console for MySQL.<br />
<br />
<span class="comment highlight">Add details about
versions, licensing, etc. here.</span></p>
<h2>Deployment details for the PAHMA instance of MySQL</h2>
<span class="comment highlight">This is a quick and dirty
initial pass at this section, with refinement needed.</span>
<p>MySQL is provided by the IST database team, as an extra-cost
option to the IST Unix Web Farm hosting environment at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Delphi uses the MySQL Basic service, which "is appropriate for
projects which have no restricted data, modest storage requirements,
and no complex database design issues. It includes a single production
environment with limited support."&nbsp; For more information
regarding this service,&nbsp; see
<a href="http://ist.berkeley.edu/services/catalog/database/mysql" target="_blank">http://ist.berkeley.edu/services/catalog/database/mysql</a></p>
<p>In the three-tier model of the IST Unix Web Farm, it is
possible to have separate instances of databases, such as MySQL
databases, available to each of the tiers.&nbsp; This way,
development and quality assurance work that changes database contents
can be carried out without affecting the production database.</p><p>In the current instance of Delphi on the Web Farm, there are two
instances of MySQL: one shared by the development and quality assurance
environments, and another specific to the production environment.</p>
<p>The phpMyAdmin console is provided by default in the IST Unix
Web Farm
hosting environment at UC Berkeley *VERIFY THIS*, and is often provided
in other web hosting environments that support PHP.&nbsp;
phpMyAdmin can also be obtained independently from
http://www.phpmyadmin.net&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The structure of data stored in the repository: database
schemas<br />
</h2>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Discuss the
database schema -
look for descriptive text, diagrams.</span></p>
<span class="comment highlight">All
tables created in MySQL using the .sql files in /trunk/schema use the
default MyISAM storage engine,
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html

<span class="comment highlight">Discuss how the PHP
environment is configured to point to specific MySQL database
instances, including across the three tiers of the IST Unix Web Farm.</span><br />
