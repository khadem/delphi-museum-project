<h1>Delphi: Code Repository</h1>
<p>This document describes the code repository used to manage the
source code, configuration files, and other artifacts of the Delphi
project,&nbsp;used by the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology
(PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>Google Code Repository</h2>The Delphi project currently uses a free, open source code hosting site on Google Code. &nbsp;The site is located at:<br /><br />http://code.google.com/p/delphi-museum-project/<br /><br />(This site can also be accessed via an alternate URL, http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/)<br /><br />This
site was chosen, in part, because it offered a good issue tracking
system. &nbsp;Project members had previously experimented with another
open source code hosting service, SourceForge, and there is an obsolete
Delphi project site on that service as well. &nbsp;(Wikipedia also
offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_hosting_facilities" target="_blank">an article comparing multiple services of this type</a>.)
&nbsp;If and when UC Berkeley's Information Services and Technology
(IST) offers a comparable hosting site in-house, this could be
considered for hosting the service in the future.<br /><h3>Site administration and permissions</h3>The
Delphi project site on Google Code is currently owned, and hence
administered, by Patrick Schmitz. &nbsp;The site owner(s) can add or
delete owners and members via an "Administer" tab on the site,
accessible only to them.<br /><br />There is a set of project members,
any of whom can commit code, edit wiki pages, or otherwise make changes
to the content of the site.<br /><br />Finally, all other visitors to
the site have broad, primarily read-only access: to browse or download
source code, read and comment on wiki pages, and read documentation
(such as this document).<br /><br />All project owner(s) and members are identified by their Google
accounts, rather than by email addresses provided by UC Berkeley or
other institutions.<br /><h3>Version control repository</h3>Google
Code offers a Subversion-based version control repository. &nbsp;A
current version of nearly all of Delphi's code and related artifacts is
maintained there. &nbsp;The repository also&nbsp;offers access to older
revisions of each of these files, and to notes about the changes made
in each successive release.<br /><br />(One notable exception are the
back-end 'sed' scripts that are used for initial cleanup of the data
provided by PAHMA. &nbsp;As noted in <a href="deployment/back-end-tools.html">Deploying Delphi: Back-end Tools</a>,&nbsp; these scripts contain some sensitive information, so they are not included in this publicly-accessible repository.)<br /><br />You
can browse Delphi's code and related artifacts can be browsed via the
web by clicking the "Source" tab on the project's Google Code site,
then the "Browse" link under that tab. &nbsp;More typically, however,
you'll access this code base via a Subversion client - a piece of
software that allows one to interact with Subversion repositories.
&nbsp;The Subversion website maintains a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients" target="_blank">list of these clients</a> (http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients), and a Wikipedia article offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients" target="_blank">a comparison matrix of many popular clients</a> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients).<br /><h4>Public access to Delphi's code</h4>Anyone
can use a Subversion client to download Delphi's code. &nbsp;The public
URL to which anyone can point a Subversion client to download the
project's code and related artifacts is:<br /><pre>http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ delphi-museum-project-read-only</pre>From
a command-line version of the Subversion client, the command to check
out the project to a local directory named
"delphi-museum-project-read-only" is:<br /><pre>svn checkout http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ delphi-museum-project-read-only</pre><h4>Private (project member-only) access to Delphi's code</h4>Project
members can also use a Subversion client, not only to download code but
also to make changes within the project repository. &nbsp;The private
URL to which they can point a Subversion client is available by
clicking the "Source" tab on the project site, after they have logged
into their Google accounts.<br /><br />Project members use their Google
account as a username, and a googlecode.com password. &nbsp;They can
generate or update this password by clicking the "Source" tab on the
project site, and following the link provided on the "Checkout" page.
&nbsp;(This link only appears for logged-in project members.)<br /><h3>Delphi's code base</h3>(Patrick's notes about the structure and organization of Delphi's code and related artifacts goes here for starters ...)<br /></body></html>
