<title>Pushing a project across layers of the WebFarm</title>

<h3>Pushing a project across layers of the WebFarm</h3>
<p>[<i>This might fit into code-repository.html, or some other spot - you
decide.</i>]</p>
<p>We geneally do our development work in our respective branches of the
development layer, which for the PAHMA deployment is pahma-dev.berkeley.edu.
Thus, my development code is generally at <a href="http://pahma-dev.berkeley.edu/patrick/">http://pahma-dev.berkeley.edu/patrick/</a>.
When we are ready to push current checked in code to the QA layer, we should
follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check out current code into the main development trunk, on <a href="http://pahma-dev.berkeley.edu/delphi">http://pahma-dev.berkeley.edu/delphi</a>.
    Ensure that there are not writable files there (you can either clean out the
    files, or just watch the svn co carefully for any conflicts. You need not
    check out everything. Only these folders need to be checked out:
    <ol>
      <li>[root] to pick up .htaccess, favicon.ico</li>
		<li>api</li>
		<li>lib</li>
		<li>modules</li>
		<li>themes</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Verify that the config files (including <code>config.php</code> and <code>http.conf</code>)
    are up to date in the main dev trunk. This is only an issue if there are
    additions to the <code>config.php</code> file or if credentials change, etc.
    Remember that the config files are stored in the local (Berkeley) svn
    repository, under the site specific files, <code>./pahma/config/config.php.dev</code>,
    etc.</li>
	<li>Verify the functionality of the just-checked-out code, running through all
    the pages for basic functionality. You do not have to do extensive testing -
    that is why we push to QA.</li>
	<li>Send a request to the WebFarm (Unix) team (<a href="mailto:unix-tickets@berkeley.edu">unix-tickets@berkeley.edu</a>) to request the update to pahma-qa.berkeley.edu. You must reference the instance, and include specific
    instructions for the update. In the examples below, you must specify either 
	&quot;QA&quot; or &quot;PROD&quot;, as appropriate.<p>Here is a sample if you only need to update the
    code, with no need to update the config.php and other config files:</p>
	<div>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">webfarm site: pahma.berkeley.edu<br>
			webfarm user: pahma<br>
			<br>
			Please perform this svn update on&nbsp;<span class="791251406-07102008">PROD</span>:<br>
			cd ~/apache2/http-pahma/htdocs/delphi<br>
			svn up</font></b></p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>If you need to update both the code as well as the config.php and other
    config files, put the files that are not in the google svn instance into the 
	folder ~/etc (using an sftp tool or equivalent), and then use a message like this:</p>
	<div>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">webfarm site: pahma.berkeley.edu<br>
			webfarm user: pahma<br>
			<br>
			Please migrate the following file from DEV to&nbsp;<span class="791251406-07102008">PROD</span>:<br>
			~/etc/config.php.<span class="791251406-07102008">prod</span><br>
			<br>
			and copy it in to place on&nbsp;<span class="791251406-07102008">PROD</span>:<br>
			cp ~/etc/config.php.<span class="791251406-07102008">prod</span> 
			~/apache2/http-pahma/htdocs/delphi/config.php<br>
			<br>
			Also please perform this svn update on&nbsp;<span class="791251406-07102008">PROD</span>:<br>
			cd ~/apache2/http-pahma/htdocs/delphi<br>
			svn up</font></b></p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p><br></li>
	<li>It generally takes the team about a half-day to a day to respond to
    requests like this. You will get back email once they have completed the
    move, and you should immediately test the results.</li>
</ol>

<h4>General caveats and advice</h4>
<p>Since you will want to &quot;babysit&quot; the process, and given that we
only have 5X8 support on the WebFarm, it is generally best to make requests in
the early morning on a day when you can pay attention, and will have some time
to deal with any hiccups. I generally avoid doing this on Fridays, and prefer
M-W.</p>
<h3>Pushing new media to the attached storage on the WebFarm</h3>
<p>We have two units (~32GB each) of attached storage for the media files for
the PAHMA instance of Delphi. These are set up to be read-only on the Dev and QA
instances, and read-write on the production instance (that is their standard
procedure, although we do not need the RW access on production either).</p>
<p>In order to update media, we must first send a request to the WebFarm team to
make the storage writable on the Dev instance. Once this is complete, you can
manipulate the storage via a logical link under the http root of the Dev
instance, in your Unix shell, via scp, etc. I use a secure ftp tool to push
media up from my workstation or other storage. In general, you will want to test
all the new media on the Dev or QA instance before you go live with this. Since
we have only once NAS mount point, this means structuring the media on that
storage to allow side-by-side copies if you are replacing a lot of media. If you
are just adding media and leaving the old media in place, you can copy up the
new files, and then update the media tables in the Dev/QA database instance to
verify paths, etc. In any case, because there is a single NAS instance, all work
on the media must be done with extreme care. </p>
<p>If you get into trouble and need to take the site down, you can always use
the lockout mechanism in the main info table for either DB, and this will lock
out the associated Delphi layers.</p>
