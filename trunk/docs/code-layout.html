<h1>Delphi: Code Layout</h1>
<p>This document describes the code layout - the hierarchical
organization of the
source code, configuration files, and other artifacts - of the Delphi
project,&nbsp;an open source
software system that helps open up access via the web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions.<br />
</p>
For a closely related
discussion of the&nbsp;repository used to manage the code and other
artifacts for the Delphi project - in other words, where the files described below can be found and downloaded - please see <a href="code-repository.html">Delphi: Code Repository</a>.
<h2>Organization of Delphi's code within the source tree<br /></h2>(At the moment, this is nearly verbatim from Patrick Schmitz and has had only minimal editing and augmentation.)<br />By folder under the source tree:<br /><h3>/api</h3>Includes various service calls that support both other php logic as well as some ajax calls. <br /><br />Also includes some test files, like catsInFacet.php, catsForObjID.php, test*.php.<br /><br /><h3>/libs</h3>Includes mostly imported libraries like jQuery, Smarty, PEAR (for the MDB model), XPM (XPertMailer), and the Zoomify swf file. <br /><br />Also includes common libraries we developed to support ontology-related functionality. <br /><br /><h3>/modules</h3>Has the PHP files that provide most of the page functionality for Delphi.<br /><br />The files are named for the respective functional areas, and should be fairly self-evident. <br /><br /><h3>/ontologies</h3>Is where we keep the ontologies used for each deployment.<br /><br />At
this point, we only have PAHMA ontologies. Each facet is stored in a
separate file to simplify the maintenance, and there is a script to
merge these into the unified file. There is a document describing the
format: /ontologies/schema_notes.htm.<br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>/schemas</h3>Contains the SQL table creation scripts and related SQL utility scripts:<br /><ul><li>mainObjInfo.sql has most of the tables we use, and is the primary schema file.</li><li>delphi_ident.sql has the authentication and authorization tables.</li><li>addBaseRolesAndPerms.sql has an init script for the basic auth/authz info.</li><li>featured.sql has the table for the featured sets on the PAHMA home page.</li><li>grants.sql
has a template for setting up permissions on the tables for the DB user
you will use. It is just a template, and must be customized for local
username and passwords.</li><li>cat_counts.sql defines tables and the scripts to fill these tables to support various UI features.</li><li>delphi_visit.sql is not yet used.<br /></li></ul><h3><br />/themes</h3>Includes
the templates, script, CSS and static images used to produce the actual
HTML deployed on the site. This is deployment specific, however many
aspects could potentially be shared across deployments. We'll need to
consider how to better share this content at some point.<br /><br />The templates and the scripts are named for the functional areas of the UI (and/or for the specific pages) they support. <br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Future enhancements</span>:<br />The CSS file is currently monolithic.<br />There are a host of unused images we should clean up.<br /><br /><h3>/tools</h3>Is the tree for the Java classes that make up the text analysis and semantic indexing engine:<br /><ul><li>MainApp.java
has the bulk of the UI logic, and a fair amount of application glue. It
should be broken up more into clearer modules that separate UI and
application logic.<br /></li><li>TaxoNode.java and Facet.java classes support the nodes in an ontology, and facets.</li><li>ImagePathsReader.java and ImageInfo.java support the image information for objects.</li><li>MetaDataReader.java is a class that simplifies the processing of the collections metadata.</li><li>DumpColumnConfig.java models the info in the configuration file that defines how we process a metadata dump.</li><li>VocabTermsReader.java
handles the reading of a default format for vocabularies - it is fairly
specific to the TMS export format, and may need additional attention
for broader use.</li><li>DoubleHashTree.java defines the data structure
that models the terms and synonyms associated to concepts in the
ontologies. It includes support to initialize the data structure from
the XML format for the ontologies.</li><li>Counter.java, Pair.Java, PriorityQueue.java, and TextUtils.java are various utility and data structure classes.<br /></li></ul>
