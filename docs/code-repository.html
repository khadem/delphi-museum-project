<h1>Delphi: Code Repository</h1>
<p>This document describes the code repository used to manage the
source code, configuration files, and other artifacts of the Delphi
project,&nbsp;an open source
software system that helps open up access via the web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions.<br />
<br />
It also
briefly discusses the use of this repository with the instance of
Delphi used by the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
For a related discussion
of the hierarchical organization of the code and other artifacts for
the Delphi project, please see <a href="code-layout.html">Delphi: Code Layout</a>.
<h2>Google Code Repository</h2>
The Delphi project currently uses a no-cost, open source code hosting
site on Google Code. &nbsp;The site is located at:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/delphi-museum-project/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/delphi-museum-project/</a><br />
<br />
(This site can also be accessed via an alternate URL, <a href="http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/" target="_blank">http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/</a>)<br />
<br />
This
site was chosen, in part, because it offered a good issue tracking
system. &nbsp;Project members had previously experimented with
another
open source code hosting service, SourceForge, and there is an obsolete
Delphi project site on that service as well. &nbsp;(Wikipedia also
offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_hosting_facilities" target="_blank">an article comparing multiple services of
this type</a>.)<br />
<br />
If
and when UC Berkeley's Information Services and Technology (IST) offers
a comparable hosting site in-house, this could be considered for
hosting the service in the future.<br />
<h3>Site administration and permissions</h3>
The
Delphi project site on Google Code is currently owned, and hence
administered, by Patrick Schmitz. &nbsp;The site owner(s) can add
or
delete owners and members via an "Administer" tab on the site; this tab
appears only to the owner(s).<br />
<br />
There is a set of project
members, any of whom can commit code, edit wiki pages, or otherwise
make changes to the content of the site.<br />
<br />
Finally, all other
visitors to the site have broad, primarily read-only access: to browse
or download source code, read and comment on wiki pages, and read
documentation (such as this document).<br />
<br />
All project owner(s) and members are identified by their Google
accounts, rather than by email addresses provided by UC Berkeley or
other institutions.<br />
<h3>Version control repository</h3>
Google
Code offers a Subversion-based version control repository. &nbsp;A
current version of nearly all of Delphi's code and related artifacts is
maintained there. &nbsp;The repository also&nbsp;offers access
to older
revisions of each of these files, and to notes about the changes made
in each successive release.<br />
<br />
(One notable exception are the
back-end 'sed' scripts that are used for initial cleanup of the data
provided by PAHMA. &nbsp;As noted in <a href="deployment/back-end-tools.html">Deploying Delphi:
Back-end Tools</a>,&nbsp; these scripts contain some
sensitive information, so they are not included in this
publicly-accessible repository.)<br />
<br />
You
can browse Delphi's code and related artifacts can be browsed via the
web by clicking the "Source" tab on the project's Google Code site,
then the "Browse" link under that tab. &nbsp;More typically,
however,
you'll access this code base via a Subversion client - a piece of
software that allows one to interact with Subversion repositories.
&nbsp;The Subversion website maintains a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients" target="_blank">list of these clients</a>
(http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients), and a Wikipedia
article offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients" target="_blank">a comparison matrix of many popular clients</a>
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients).<br />
<h4>Public access to Delphi's code</h4>
Anyone
can use a Subversion client to download Delphi's code. &nbsp;The
public
URL to which anyone can point a Subversion client to download the
project's code and related artifacts is:<br />
<pre>http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ delphi-museum-project-read-only</pre>
From
a command-line version of the Subversion client, the command to check
out the entire set of project code and related artifacts, to a local
directory named "delphi-museum-project-read-only", is:<br />
<pre>svn checkout http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ delphi-museum-project-read-only</pre>
<h4>Private (project member-only) access to Delphi's code</h4>
Project
members can also use a Subversion client, not only to download code but
also to make changes within the project repository. &nbsp;The
private
URL to which they can point a Subversion client is available by
clicking the "Source" tab on the project site, after they have logged
into their Google accounts.<br />
<br />
Project members use their Google
account as a username, and a googlecode.com password. &nbsp;They
can
generate or update this password by clicking the "Source" tab on the
project site, and clicking the link provided on the "Checkout" page
under that tab. &nbsp;(This link only appears for logged-in project
members.)<br />

<h2>Use of the Code Repository with the PAHMA instance of Delphi</h2><span class="comment highlight">
Verify
whether the IST Unix Web Farm uses the Google Code-provided Subversion
repository in migrations between the Web Farm's tiers. &nbsp;Determine how this is configured on the Web Farm.</span><br />
