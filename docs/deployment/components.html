<h1>Deploying Delphi: Components</h1>
<p>There are three major components to the current Delphi
deployment used by the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>A web-based application</strong>
<p>A web-based application, the Delphi "collections browser,"
allows virtual museum visitors to explore the museum's collections over
the web.&nbsp; Visitors can search for artifacts, via both concepts
and keywords, and can interactively browse their various "facets" (e.g.
location, culture, materials).</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">Decide
whether, and if so how, to introduce the personal annotation and
community curation aspects of Delphi here. -Aron Roberts 10/22/08 4:01
PM</span></p>
<p>Currently, the Delphi collections browser application runs
in the Apache Web Server.&nbsp; It consists of a number of
interrelated components that are more fully described below, including
PHP application code and libraries; Smarty templates; JavaScript
application code and libraries; a Flash-based tool to allow users to
zoom-and-pan through images; and CSS style sheets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A data repository</strong>
<p>The data repository is used for storing the data about
artifacts in the collections ("metadata") provided by PAHMA.</p>
<p>This repository is also used for storing supplementary
data – indexes of terms, synonyms/antonyms, and concepts – that is
"mined" from the metadata.&nbsp; This data about underlying
meanings ... helps users of Delphi's collections browser locate
artifacts by concepts, and uncover relationships between artifacts.</p>
<p>The data stored in the respository is used by the
collections browser, above, as well as for reporting and other purposes.</p>
<p>Currently, the data repository is a MySQL relational
database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A set of back-end tools</strong>
<p>These tools allow Delphi's administrators and others to
analyze and process data about the artifacts in the collection – both
metadata and semantic data – and to load this data into the data
repository.</p>
<p>Currently, these tools are run manually, in batch mode,
via a Java-based GUI application.&nbsp; Future Delphi enhancements
may automate some of these back-end processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three components, along with their associated
sub-components, described further below, will also be present in any
highly similar instances of Delphi that are deployed and run outside
PAHMA.</p>
<p>In addition to the three major components listed above, other
important components of the Delphi project include the code repository
for the project – where its source code, templates, configuration
files, libraries, and other files are stored, and its issues are
tracked – and its set of associated documentation, papers and articles.</p>
<p>For more information about the code repository, please see: ...</p>
<p>For links to associated documentation, papers and articles,
please see: ...</p>
<h2>1. Web-based application</h2>
<p>The web-based collections browser consists of a set of
required sub-components, described further below.</p>
<h3>1.1 Hosting Environment<br />
</h3>
<p>The web-based collections browser runs in a web hosting
environment: a server or collection of servers that accept web
connections over the Internet.&nbsp; Web hosting environments
typically provide some combination of base-level and optional services,
such as hardware support for the server computers; network
administration; system administration services, such as maintaining
operating systems, server software, and certain other software
packages; storage; and data backups.&nbsp; This allows application
providers to focus exclusively on providing their own services via the
Web.<br />
</p>
<h4><strong>IST Unix Web Farm</strong></h4>
<p>The web hosting environment for the instance of Delphi used by
PAHMA runs on the Unix Web Farm, a Web hosting service provided by
Information Services and Technology (IST) at UC Berkeley, which is
located in the Campus Data Center.&nbsp; For more details regarding
the Web Farm, please see <a href="http://ist.berkeley.edu/services/is/unix/webfarm">http://ist.berkeley.edu/services/is/unix/webfarm</a>.</p>
<p>The IST Web Farm provides a three-tier hosting model,
consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A development ("dev") environment.</li>
<li>A quality assurance ("qa") environment.</li>
<li>A production ("prod") environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes to Delphi – such as to libraries, code, templates, and
configuration files – are first tested within the development
environment.&nbsp; They are then migrated to the quality assurance
environment, and after further testing there, to the production
environment.</p>
<p>Currently, all of the files required by the various required
sub-components of the collection browser are maintained under version
control, in a code repository.&nbsp; (For a detailed discussion,
please see Delphi-Deployment-Code Repository.)&nbsp; When
migrations between tiers are requested, the administrators of the IST
Unix Web Farm obtain the latest set of files from this code repository
and install them on the next tier in sequence.</p>
<p>Delphi's web-based application does not require the use of a
three-tier hosting model.&nbsp; However, several of its
configuration files, used by the PAHMA instance, currently reflect this
model.</p>
<h3>1.2 Web Server<br />
</h3>
<p>The web hosting environment includes a web server, which
accepts connections from web browsers and returns web pages or other
content, either from a filesystem or from programming code that returns
pages from other types of repositories or that generates web pages
dynamically.<br />
</p>
<h4><strong>Apache Web Server</strong></h4>
<p>The collections browser application for the instance of Delphi
used by PAHMA runs within the open source Apache Web Server.</p>
<p>Apache version 2 is provided by default in the IST Unix Web
Farm hosting environment at UC Berkeley.&nbsp; Apache (either major
versions 1 or 2, or sometimes both) often provided in other Web hosting
environments.</p>
<p>Configuration:</p>
<em>Location in Delphi code repository:</em>&nbsp; An
Apache configuration file (".htaccess") in /trunk
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">Look
for other configuration details that differ from the stock Web Farm
configuration file. -Aron Roberts 10/21/08 9:38 PM</span><br />
</p>
<h3>
1.3 Application components</h3>
While running within its hosting environment and web server, above, the
application itself is composed of a number of sub-components.&nbsp;
In combination, these allow the application to respond to user input by
pulling the appropriate data from the data repository and returning
dynamically-created web pages, based on the user's requests.
<p>These sub-components include including PHP application code
and libraries; Smarty templates; JavaScript application code and
libraries; libraries for zooming and panning images and sending email;
and CSS style sheets:</p>
<h4>PHP</h4>
<p><em>Description:</em> PHP is "a widely-used
general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web
development and can be embedded into HTML."<br />
</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: Web pages in Delphi are
generated dynamically via the PHP programming language.<br />
</p>
<p>There are two components that support the use of PHP in this
manner:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The PHP language package itself.
<p>PHP is provided by default in the IST Unix Web Farm
hosting environment at UC Berkeley, and is often provided in other Web
hosting environments. *VERIFY THE FIRST ASSERTION; THIS MAY NOT BE
ACCURATE*</p>
</li>
<li>The installation of PHP as a shared module for the Apache
Web Server.
<p>This allows the processing of PHP code, inserted on Web
pages using special tags, to create dynamic content on those pages.</p>
<p>This shared module is provided with Apache by default in
the IST Unix Web Farm hosting environment at UC Berkeley, and is often
provided in other web hosting environments that support PHP.&nbsp;
*VERIFY THE FIRST ASSERTION*</p>
<p>Instructions on installing PHP within the Apache web
server are provided at http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.ph</p>

</p>
<h4>Smarty</h4>
<em>Description</em>: Smarty is an open source template
engine and presentation framework for PHP.<br />
<br />
Smarty, which is itself written in PHP, allows PHP programmers to
dynamically create web pages and other text output by executing
commands that are inserted into template files.&nbsp; Smarty
template files typically contain Smarty code interspersed within static
elements, such as HTML markup.
<p>(Smarty is roughly analogous to ASP, JSP, or ColdFusion; and
to template engines like FreeMarker and Velocity for Java, and the
Template Toolkit for Perl and Python.)</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: Smarty templates are used
to generate all of the HTML pages presented by the web-based
collections browser. *VERIFY THIS*</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: http://www.smarty.net/</p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:&nbsp;
2.6.18<br />
</p>
<p><em>Latest version (stable)</em>: 2.6.20 (Released
2008-08-15)</p>
<p><em>Licensing terms</em>:</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi code repository:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Delphi's installation of the Smarty framework itself
consists of a collection of PHP code (".php") files in
svn/trunk/libs/pear</li>
<li>Delphi's Smarty templates are the collection of template
(".tpl") files in svn/trunk/themes/pahma/templates</li>
<li>Delphi's PHP source code, which produces the data that is
'poured' into Smarty template files to dynamically generate web pages,
is contained in the set of PHP code (".php") files in
svn/trunk/modules.&nbsp; There is also related code, used by some
those code modules, in svn/trunk/api and svn/trunk/libs/ontology<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h4>XPertMailer</h4>

annotations - sending URLs to personally-created sets via
email.&nbsp; *VERIFY THIS - AND ANY OTHERS?*</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: http://www.xpertmailer.com/</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi code repository:</em>&nbsp;
Delphi's installation of the XPertMailer package is provided as a
collection of PHP code (".php") files in /trunk/libs/XPM</p>
<h4>jQuery</h4>
<p><em>Description</em>: jQuery is an open source,
general purpose JavaScript framework: a library of routines -
themselves written in JavaScript - that provide enhancements to the
core JavaScript language.&nbsp; jQuery is known for the conciseness
of its expressions; for its active developer community, which has
provided many extensions to the framework; and for working properly
within the JavaScript engines built into most modern web browsers.</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: Many of the user
interactions in the collections browser, such as managing collapsible
and expandable "trees" of links to facets that can be browsed, are
handled via JavaScript.&nbsp; In Delphi, a great deal of this
JavaScript code makes calls to functions provided by jQuery, and its
user interface library, jQuery UI (below).&nbsp; *VERIFY THIS*</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: http://jquery.com/</p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:<br />
</p>
<p><em>Latest version</em>: 1.2.6 (released
2008-05-24)</p>
<p><em>Licensing terms</em>:</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi code repository:</em>&nbsp;
A collection of JavaScript (".js") files in svn/trunk/libs/jquery<em><br />
</em></p>
<em>Issues (very rough notes, needs cleanup, needs entry of
and/or references to bugs in Google Code)</em>:
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">Mention
performance concerns in building the trees and links.&nbsp; (One
suggested approach was to further restrict the 'genericity' levels -
easier for location, more difficult for other facets) or more generally
to prune trees both top and bottom before handing off to jQuery.) -Aron
Roberts 10/21/08 3:51 PM</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">Note
home page issue regarding possibly not generating simplified
(mod_rewrite-handled) URLs in links. -Aron Roberts 10/21/08 3:51 PM</span><br />
</p>
<h4>jQuery UI</h4>
<p><em>Description</em>: Built on jQuery (above),
jQuery UI is
a library for handling user interaction within web-based
applications.&nbsp; It offers a variety of UI widgets that can be
placed on a web page, as well as allowing applications to more easily
respond to a user's behavior on a page, such as mouse clicks and drags.</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: One of the widgets used
heavily by Delphi is the jQuery UI "accordion" widget, "an
expandable/collapsible content pane." *VERIFY THIS*</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: http://ui.jquery.com/</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi code repository:</em>&nbsp;
A collection of JavaScript (".js") files in /trunk/libs/jquery</p>
<h4><strong>Zoomify</strong></h4>
<p>(placeholder - also need to determine which package is in use)</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: http://www.zoomify.com/</p>
<p>Licensing:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">Patrick
2008-10-23: I have a personal license for the Zoomify runtime that
entitles me to redistribute it. I used this when consulting to the
museum, and I think it holds for the PAHMA deployment, but I doubt that
it holds for the Delphi project. Will have to straighten this out as
well. We may have to tell deployers to get the runtime from Zoomify
(they allow redist for any users). -Aron Roberts 10/23/08 12:42 PM</span></p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi code repository:</em>&nbsp;
A single Adobe Shockwave (".swf") file in /trunk/libs/zoom</p>
<h4>CSS</h4>
<p><em>Description:&nbsp;</em> Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) are a technology, rather than a product: a specification
from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp; CSS makes it
possible to specify text fonts and styles, colors, layout positioning,
and other presentation aspects of Web pages.&nbsp; These are
specified by a set of appearance and layout definitions ("selectors"),
contained in stylesheets, that can be selectively applied to specific
parts of a web page.<br />
<em><br />
Use in Delphi</em>:&nbsp; CSS is used to specify the text
fonts and styles, colors, layout position, and other presentation
aspects of the collection browser's Web pages.</p>
<p>The HTML output generated by Delphi's collections browser, via
Smarty templates, does not contain information about how it will be
displayed on a web page.&nbsp; Rather, it contains 'decorations,'
such as the "class" and "id" attributes that uniquely identify various
HTML elements, that allow those elements to be styled, colored, and
positioned on the page through the use of CSS stylesheets.</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>:&nbsp; As a technology,
CSS is documented at http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/</p>
<p>(Random notes)</p>
<p>Support for CSS is built into all modern web
browsers.&nbsp; There are some variances in support for CSS
features, and in the rendering of Web pages based those features, in
different Web browsers.&nbsp; However, over time, there has been a
trend toward more uniform support for CSS among browsers.&nbsp; <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">Another recent
trend is the growing adoption of version 3 of the CSS specification
(CSS 3). -Aron Roberts 10/23/08 11:53 AM</span></p>
<p>Nearly all aspects of the presentation of the collections
browser's web pages can be customized simply by changing styles in CSS
stylesheets, along with replacing static image files.&nbsp;
However, some forms of significant customization may also require
changes to one or more of Delphi's Smarty templates.&nbsp; For
instance, if it is desired to change the format of certain lists of
results returned from searching or browsing ...</p>
<p><em>Issues (very rough notes, needs cleanup, needs entry
of and/or references to bugs in Google Code)</em>:</p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">The
collections browser currently uses a single large CSS file, style.css.
-Aron Roberts 10/21/08 7:22 PM</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">Opportunities
to parameterize the CSS file(s), for instance to allow one or more
theme colors to be provided externally, rather than being hard-coded as
values in the stylesheet. -Aron Roberts 10/21/08 7:22 PM</span><br />
</p>
<h2>
2. A data repository
</h2>
The data repository is where data used by the web-based application is
stored.&nbsp; Data is placed into this repository using the
back-end tools, below.
<h3><strong>MySQL</strong></h3>
<p>The data repository for the instance of Delphi used by PAHMA
is MySQL, an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).</p>
<p>MySQL is provided by the IST database team, as an extra-cost
option to the IST Unix Web Farm hosting environment at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Delphi uses the MySQL Basic service, which "is appropriate for
projects which have no restricted data, modest storage requirements,
and no complex database design issues. It includes a single production
environment with limited support."&nbsp; For more information
regarding this service, please see
http://ist.berkeley.edu/services/catalog/database/mysql</p>
<p>In the three-tier model of the IST Unix Web Farm, it is
possible to have separate instances of databases, such as MySQL
databases, available to each of the tiers.&nbsp; This way,
development and quality assurance work that changes database contents
can be carried out without affecting the production database.&nbsp;
In the current instance of Delphi on the Web Farm, there are two
instances of MySQL: one shared by the development and quality assurance
environments, and another specific to the production environment.
*VERIFY THIS*</p>
<p>A relational database was chosen primarily for
performance.&nbsp; The Delphi team had considered other types of
data repositories, such as a triple store that is optimized for storing
and retrieving Resource Description Framework (RDF) and similar
metadata. *VERIFY THIS*</p>
<h3><strong>phpMyAdmin</strong></h3>
<p>phpMyAdmin is an open source administration console for MySQL.</p>
<p>This console is provided by default in the IST Unix Web Farm
hosting environment at UC Berkeley *VERIFY THIS*, and is often provided
in other web hosting environments that support PHP.&nbsp;
phpMyAdmin can also be obtained from http://www.phpmyadmin.net&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<h2>3. Back-end tools</h2>
(Placeholder text; need to incorporate Patrick's process descriptions,
better summaries of this analysis data mining work from the I-School
report and otherwise)
<p><em>Description</em>: A set of back-end tools are
provided for processing and analyzing data about the artifacts in the
collection, and to load this data into a data repository.&nbsp;
These tools aren't directly accessible to virtual museum visitors, but
rather, they are used behind the scenes.</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: These back-end tools are
used primarily to prepare data for access by the web-based collections
browser.</p>
<p>This data is also used for other purposes, as well.&nbsp;
For instance, it is used to generate reports for museum staff, IT
personnel, and researchers: to help them better understand the
collection, find and correct errors in cataloging, and iteratively
improve Delphi's natural language processing, among other purposes.*</p>
<p>Currently, extracts of data from the museum's collections
management system are created, at various intervals, by PAHMA
staff.&nbsp; These extracts to date have typically consisted of
between one and eight separate files.</p>
<p>This data is then provided to Delphi's administrators, who
process the data using these back-end tools.&nbsp; These tools must
be run manually – in batch mode – and in a particular
sequence.&nbsp; A Java-based GUI application, MainApp, provides a
unified control panel for many of these tools; its menu options provide
some guidance for what steps must be performed, and in what
order.&nbsp; Some other tools are run separately, outside of
MainApp.&nbsp; A proposed future enhancement to Delphi is to
automate many parts of this back-end workflow.</p>
<p>As an abstract, high-level overview, these back-end tools
perform the following tasks (*VERIFY THIS -&nbsp; THIS HAS BEEN
WRITTEN AS A PLACEHOLDER WITHOUT REFERENCING ANY DOCUMENTATION*)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Cleaning up" the data ("metadata") for each of the
artifacts in the collection.
<p>Examples of clean-up include removing "sensitive, stale or
otherwise undesired noise" from the metadata.&nbsp; For instance,
sensitive data, such as donor names and the prices of artifacts, need
to be removed before this data can be stored in the data repository.</p>
<p>It's also helpful to be clear about what Delphi's cleanup
work <em>doesn't</em> attempt to do.&nbsp; When many
different people enter data about the artifacts in a collection,
especially over a considerable period of time, there will inevitably be
considerable variance in this data.&nbsp; Sometimes, data entered
even for two highly similar artifacts can contain significant
differences.&nbsp; While sets of terms ("controlled vocabularies")
and other curatorial practices can reduce this variance, they can't
eliminate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delphi's back-end tools generally don't try to correct or
standardize metadata about artifacts, although Delphi's cleanup work
and its other back-end workflows can occasionally reveal specific
issues that can readily be addressed by curators.&nbsp; Rather,
they build new data that ...</p>
<p>... identify sets of terms, found in different data
fields, all of which may correspond to a particular concept or
sub-concept.&nbsp; This helps tie together sets of related
artifacts whose metadata wouldn't otherwise make clear their similarity.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</li>
<li>Scanning this metadata and determining what concepts
("facets") in a previously-developed mental model ("ontology") apply to
each artifact.
<p>By associating concepts with artifacts, this allows
virtual museum visitors to more powerfully search and browse the
collections than is possible by searching or browsing the metadata
alone.&nbsp; This also helps museum staff, scholars, and others
better understand the collections and find emerging patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>Build and maintain the mental model ("ontology"),
independently of any data about artifacts.
<p>The mental model used in the instance of Delphi for PAHMA
is specific to the archeological artifacts in that museum's
collections.&nbsp; While it does contain many concepts that are
germane to many types of artifacts, when used with instances of Delphi
outside PAHMA this model will likely need to be changed.</p>
<p>In Delphi's back-end tools, the association between
concepts in the mental model, and text that appears in one or more of
the fields of the data ("metadata") for each of the artifacts in the
collection, is maintained as ... XML ...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</li>
<li>Load the data – about the artifacts in the collection, the
associations between artifacts and their associated concepts, and the
mental model that defines those concepts – into a data
repository.&nbsp; This allows the data to be flexibly accessed at
high speed.</li>

<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 215);">It
would be desirable if updates to the data in the repository could occur
more frequently, to be more responsive to ongoing changes to the
museum's collections.&nbsp; This might require changes both in the
museum's processes and in the back-end tools and workflows.&nbsp;
For instance, the current load scripts wipe out ("drop"), recreate, and
reload database tables with new data, rather than performing a set of
inserts, updates, and deletions. -Aron Roberts 10/22/08 3:58 PM</span></p>
