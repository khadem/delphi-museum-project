<h1>Deploying Delphi: Collections Browser</h1>
<div class="draftnote">
<p>This is a draft page, in ongoing development. It is still
rough, but we are exposing it to the community
for review and to help anyone considering a Delphi deployment. We are
actively updating all of the documentation, so it is best to use this
resource online, rather than printing out a version.</p>
</div>
<p>
This is an overview of the web-based collections browser in Delphi, an
open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions. &nbsp;
Delphi uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.<br />
<br />
The collections browser, a web-based application, allows a virtual
'visitor' to a museum or heritage institution - including researchers,
members of the public, and even the museum's or institution's own staff
- to interactively explore the collections over the Internet. &nbsp;At
each page, the visitor is presented not only with photos and (when
available) photos of the artifacts they have selected through searching
or browsing, but also a "tree" of concepts&nbsp;relevant to those
artifacts. &nbsp;Each of these concepts, in turn, falls under a
category, or "facet," such as&nbsp;location, culture, and materials
used. &nbsp;This helps visitors better understand the characteristics
and scope of the set of artifacts they're viewing at any one time.
&nbsp;It also helps them further refine their searching or browsing, as
well giving them starting points for&nbsp;exploring related parts of
the collections.<br /><br />The collections browser application currently
consists of the following set of required sub-components:</p>
<h2>1. Web hosting environment<br />
</h2>
<p>The collections browser runs in a <span style="font-style: italic;">web hosting
environment</span>: a server or collection of servers that accept
web
connections over the Internet.&nbsp; Web hosting environments
typically provide some combination of base-level and optional services,
such as hardware support for the server computers; network
administration; system administration services, such as maintaining
operating systems, server software, and certain other software
packages; storage; and data backups.&nbsp; This allows application
providers to focus exclusively on providing their own services via the
Web.<br />
</p>
<h3><strong>1.1. IST Unix Web Farm</strong></h3>
<p>The web hosting environment for the instance of Delphi used by
PAHMA runs on the Unix Web Farm, a Web hosting service provided by
Information Services and Technology (IST) at UC Berkeley, which is
located in the Campus Data Center.&nbsp; For more details regarding
the Web Farm, please see <a href="http://ist.berkeley.edu/services/is/unix/webfarm">http://ist.berkeley.edu/services/is/unix/webfarm</a>.</p>
<p>The IST Web Farm provides a three-tier hosting model,
consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A development ("dev") environment.</li>
<li>A quality assurance ("qa") environment.</li>
<li>A production ("prod") environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes to Delphi - such as to libraries, code, templates,
and
configuration files - are first tested within the development
environment.&nbsp; They are then migrated to the quality assurance
environment, and after further testing there, to the production
environment. &nbsp;Migrations are requested either by sending email
to
the IST Enterprise Unix team, or by entering a new ticket in an IST
issue tracking system.<br />
<br />
By
IST Web Farm convention, one accesses the hosts running on the
development and quality assurance tiers - using web browsers or similar
service clients - using a hostname that is a combination of the
registered hostname, followed by a hyphen ("-") and the abbreviation
for the tier. &nbsp;Thus, for the instance of Delphi used by PAHMA,
the
hostnames for accessing the development, quality assurance, and
production environments are, respectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>pahma-dev.berkeley.edu</li>
<li>pahma-qa.berkeley.edu</li>
<li>pahma.berkeley.edu</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, all of the files required by the various required
sub-components of the collection browser are maintained under version
control, in a code repository.&nbsp; (For a detailed discussion,
please see <a href=".../code-repository.html">Delphi:
Code Repository</a>.)&nbsp; When
migrations between tiers are requested, the administrators of the IST
Unix Web Farm obtain the latest set of files from this code repository
and install them on the next tier in sequence.</p>
<p>Delphi's web-based application does not require the use of a
three-tier hosting model.&nbsp; However, several of its
configuration files, used by the PAHMA instance, currently reflect this
model.</p>
<h2>2. Web server<br />
</h2>
<p>The web hosting environment includes a <span style="font-style: italic;">web server</span>, which
accepts connections from web browsers and returns web pages or other
content, either from a filesystem or from programming code that returns
pages from other types of repositories or that generates web pages
dynamically.<br />
</p>
<h3><strong>2.1. Apache Web Server</strong></h3>
<p>The collections browser application for the instance of Delphi
used by PAHMA runs within the open source Apache Web Server.</p>
<p>Apache version 2 is provided by default in the IST Unix Web
Farm hosting environment at UC Berkeley.&nbsp; Apache is also
frequently provided in other Web hosting
environments.<em></em></p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:
2.2.4<br />
(The installed version is chosen by the adminstrators of the IST Unix
Web Farm. &nbsp;It was identified by running the Apache-provided <code>apachectl</code>
script
with the <code>-v</code> option.)<em></em></p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi <a href="../code-repository.html">code
repository</a>:</em>&nbsp; The Apache Web Server is not
itself provided in the Delphi source
code tree. &nbsp;Rather, it needs to be present or installed within
the web hosting environment.</p>
<p>However, a configuration file that works in conjunction with
the Apache
Web Server, <code>.htaccess</code>, is included at the
top level of the source code tree (in <code>/trunk</code>).
</p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Look
for other configuration details that differ from the stock Web Farm
configuration file.</span>
</p>
<h2>3. Collections browser application components</h2>
<p>While running within its hosting environment and web server,
above, the
collections browser itself is composed of a number of
sub-components. &nbsp;In combination, these allow the application
to respond to user input by
pulling the appropriate data from the data repository and returning
dynamically-created web pages, based on the user's requests.</p>
<p>At its core, the collections browser consists of PHP-driven
content
and template files, supported by a combination of PHP libraries;
JavaScript code and
libraries; CSS style sheets, and a Flash-based tool to allow users to
zoom-and-pan through images. &nbsp;These sub-components are
described below.</p>
<h3>3.1. PHP (a scripting language)</h3>
<p><em>Description:</em> PHP is "a widely-used
general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web
development and can be embedded into HTML."<br />
</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: Web pages in Delphi are
generated dynamically via the PHP programming language.<br />
</p>
<p>There are two components that support the use of PHP in this
manner:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The PHP language package itself.
<p>PHP is provided by default in the IST Unix Web Farm
hosting environment at UC Berkeley, and is often provided in other Web
hosting environments.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment highlight">&nbsp;Verify the first
assertion.</span></p>
</li>
<li>The installation of PHP as a shared module for the Apache
Web Server.
<p>This allows the processing of PHP code, inserted on Web
pages using special tags, to create dynamic content on those pages.</p>
<p>This shared module is provided with Apache by default in
the IST Unix Web Farm hosting environment at UC Berkeley, and is often
provided in other web hosting environments that support PHP.&nbsp; <span class="comment highlight">&nbsp;Verify the first assertion.</span></p>
<p>Instructions on installing PHP within the Apache web
server are provided at <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.ph" target="_blank">http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.ph</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">http://www.php.net/</a><em></em></p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:
5.x<br />
(The installed version is chosen by the adminstrators of the IST Unix
Web Farm.)<br />
<span class="comment highlight">Verify
this, as well as the specific installed version.</span>
</p>
<p><em>Latest version (stable)</em>: 5.2.6
(2008-05-01)</p>
<p><em>Licensing terms</em>: PHP License, version
3.0.1 (as of 2008-10-23), <a href="http://us2.php.net/license/" target="_blank">http://us2.php.net/license/</a>&nbsp;
"Essentially, the PHP license gives you the right to use, distribute
and modify PHP as much as you want, for both commercial and
non-commercial use. You just have to make it clear to the user that
what you have distributed contains PHP."</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi <a href="../code-repository.html">code repository</a>:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The PHP language package is not itself provided in the Delphi source
code tree. &nbsp;Rather, it needs to be present or installed within
the web hosting environment, as does the PHP shared module for the
Apache
Web Server.<br />
<br />
However,
code and libraries that use the PHP language are distributed throughout
many parts of Delphi's code repository. &nbsp;Many of these are
detailed below.</p>
<h3>3.2. PEAR::MDB2 (a PHP database library)</h3>
<p><em>Description:</em> Pear::MDB2 ("MDB2") is an
open source
package that extends the core PHP language to provide
programmers with a common interface to many different types of
relational databases.</p>
<p>(Pear is a packaging and distribution system for PHP packages,
somewhat akin to CPAN for Perl packages.)<br />
</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>:&nbsp;MDB2 routines are
used to access data in the MySQL-based data repository.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>:
<a href="http://pear.php.net/package/MDB2" target="_blank">http://pear.php.net/package/MDB2</a><br />

2.4.0<br />
(Identified by a constant in the source code file <code>MDB2.php</code>)</p>
<p><em>Latest version (stable)</em>: 2.4.1 (released
on 2007-05-03)<em><br /></em>
</p>
<p><em>Licensing terms</em>: &nbsp;PHP License,
version
3.0.1 (as of 2008-10-23), <a href="http://us2.php.net/license/" target="_blank">http://us2.php.net/license/</a>&nbsp;
"Essentially, the PHP license gives you the right to use, distribute
and modify PHP as much as you want, for both commercial and
non-commercial use. You just have to make it clear to the user that
what you have distributed contains PHP."<br />
<br />
(The parent Pear project allows developers who distribute their
packages via Pear to choose any of &nbsp;five different open source
licenses, as described in <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/faq.devs.php#faq.licenses" target="_blank">http://pear.php.net/manual/en/faq.devs.php#faq.licenses</a>
as of 2008-11-05.)</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi <a href="../code-repository.html">code repository</a>:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Delphi's installation of the Pear::MD2 package is provided as a
collection of PHP code (".php") files in /trunk/libs/pear</p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Note
where database connections are configured, in the config.sample.php
file at the top-level of the source code tree.</span>
</p>
<h3>3.3. Smarty (a PHP template library)</h3>
<p><em>Description</em>: Smarty is an open source
template
engine and presentation framework for PHP.
</p>
<p>Smarty, which is itself written in PHP, allows PHP programmers
to
dynamically create web pages and other text output by executing
commands that are inserted into template files. &nbsp;Smarty
template files typically contain Smarty code interspersed within static
elements, such as HTML markup.
</p>
<p>(Smarty is roughly analogous to ASP, JSP, or ColdFusion; and
to template engines like FreeMarker and Velocity for Java, and the
Template Toolkit for Perl and Python.)</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: Smarty templates are used
to generate all of the HTML pages presented by the web-based
collections browser. <span class="comment highlight">&nbsp;Verify
this.</span><em></em></p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: <a href="http://www.smarty.net/" target="_blank">http://www.smarty.net/</a></p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:&nbsp;
2.6.18<br />
(Identified by a comment in the header of the source code file
<code>Smarty.class.php</code>)</p>
<p><em>Latest version (stable)</em>: 2.6.20 (Released
2008-08-15)</p>
<p><em>Licensing terms</em>: &nbsp;"Smarty is
released under the LGPL (Lesser GPL)," per <a href="http://www.smarty.net/copyright.php" target="_blank">http://www.smarty.net/copyright.php</a></p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi <a href="../code-repository.html">code repository</a>:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Delphi's installation of the Smarty framework itself
consists of a collection of PHP code (".php") files in
svn/trunk/libs/pear</li>
<li>Delphi's Smarty templates are the collection of template
(".tpl") files in svn/trunk/themes/pahma/templates</li>
<li>Delphi's PHP source code, which produces the data that is
'poured' into Smarty template files to dynamically generate web pages,
is contained in the set of PHP code (".php") files in
svn/trunk/modules.&nbsp; There is also related code, used by some
of
those code modules, in svn/trunk/api and svn/trunk/libs/ontology<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.4. XPertMailer (a PHP email library)</h3>
<p><em>Description</em>: &nbsp;XPertMailer is an
email client library for PHP. &nbsp;This library can format MIME
email messages, and send those messages via an SMTP server on a local
or remote host, with support for authentication when relaying messages
and for TLS/SSL encryption. &nbsp;It can also retrieve messages via
POP3. </p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: XPertMailer is used in several situations in
which Delphi sends email to users of the collections browser.
&nbsp;These include interactions related to user accounts, where Delphi
sends email when a new user registers or when an existing user requests
that their forgotten password be reset. &nbsp;These also include
interactions around sharing personal
annotations, where Delphi can email URLs that allow others to&nbsp;view
your personally-saved sets. <span class="comment highlight">&nbsp;Verify
this.</span></p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: <a href="http://www.xpertmailer.com/" target="_blank">http://www.xpertmailer.com/</a></p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:<br />
(Was not readily able to identify this from examining the XPertMailer files in
the source tree.)<em><br />
<br />
Latest version (stable)</em>: 0.5<em><br />
<br />
Licensing terms</em>: Dual licensed,&nbsp;GPL and LGPL
(Lesser GPL). &nbsp;The version of XPertMailer included in the
source tree contains a license file referencing GNU General Public
License version 2.0 or any later version.
</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi <a href="../code-repository.html">code repository</a>:</em>&nbsp;
Delphi's installation of the XPertMailer package is provided as a
collection of PHP code (".php") files in /trunk/libs/XPM</p>
<h3>3.5. jQuery (a JavaScript library)</h3>
<p><em>Description</em>: jQuery is an open source,
general purpose JavaScript framework: a library of routines -
themselves written in JavaScript - that provide enhancements to the
core JavaScript language.&nbsp; jQuery is known for the conciseness
of its expressions; for its active developer community, which has
provided many extensions to the framework; and for working properly
within the JavaScript engines built into most modern web browsers.</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: Many of the user
interactions in the collections browser, such as managing collapsible
and expandable "trees" of links to facets that can be browsed, are
handled via JavaScript.&nbsp; In Delphi, a great deal of this
JavaScript code makes calls to functions provided by jQuery, and its
user interface library, jQuery UI (below). <span class="comment highlight">&nbsp;Verify this.</span></p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">http://jquery.com/</a></p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:
&nbsp;1.2.1<br />
(Identified by the name of the
<code>jquery-n.n.n-pack.js</code> file, where '<code>n.n.n</code>'
is the package version number.)<br />
</p>
<p><em>Latest version (stable)</em>: 1.2.6 (released
2008-05-24)</p>
<p><em>Licensing terms</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Dual-licensed
under two extremely permissive licenses. &nbsp;"jQuery is currently
available for use in all personal or commercial projects under both MIT
and GPL licenses," according to <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Licensing" target="_blank">http://docs.jquery.com/Licensing</a></p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi <a href="../code-repository.html">code repository</a>:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;A
collection of JavaScript (".js") files in svn/trunk/libs/jquery<em></em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Mention
performance concerns in building the trees and links.&nbsp; (One
suggested approach was to further restrict the 'genericity' levels -
easier for location, more difficult for other facets) or more generally
to prune trees both top and bottom before handing off to jQuery.)</span></p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Note
home page-only issue regarding possibly not generating simplified
(mod_rewrite-handled) URLs in links.</span><br />
</p>
<h3>3.6. jQuery UI (a JavaScript library)</h3>
<p><em>Description</em>: Built on jQuery (above),
jQuery UI is
a library for handling user interaction within web-based
applications.&nbsp; It offers a variety of UI widgets that can be
placed on a web page, as well as allowing applications to more easily
respond to a user's behavior on a page, such as mouse clicks and drags.</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: One of the widgets used
heavily by Delphi is the jQuery UI "accordion" widget, "an
expandable/collapsible content pane." <span class="comment highlight">Verify this.</span></p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>: <a href="http://ui.jquery.com/" target="_blank">http://ui.jquery.com/</a></p>
<p><em>Installed version in Delphia's PAHMA instance</em>:<br />
(Was not able to readily identify the version of jQuery UI. &nbsp;It is included in header of&nbsp;the file <code>ui.core.js</code>,
which does not appear to be in the source tree. &nbsp;Other individual files in the
installed distribution either have varying version numbers, or none at
all; this issue has also been noted in comments in the product mailing list.)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</p>
<p><em>Latest version (stable)</em>: 1.5.2</p>
<p><em>Licensing terms</em>: &nbsp;Appears to be
dual-licensed under both the GPL and MIT License. &nbsp;(See
Licensing terms for jQuery, above.)</p>
<p><em>Location in Delphi <a href="../code-repository.html">code repository</a>:</em>&nbsp;
A collection of JavaScript (".js") files in /trunk/libs/jquery</p>
<h3><strong>3.7. Zoomifyer EZ (a Flash-based application)</strong></h3>

<p><em>Description</em>: Zoomifyer EZ (also variously named "Zoomify
EZ" and "Zoomify Express" at various places on the vendor's website),
allows for zoom-and-pan viewing of large images within a relatively
small viewing window. &nbsp;It consists of a converter utility "to make
any image zoomable," as well as a viewer utility, implemented as a
Flash (SWF) movie file, that allows a user to interact with the image
within their browser window, using a set of provided controls to zoom
in or out, and to move about the image. &nbsp;(To use this viewer,
version 6 or later of the Flash browser plug-in must also be installed.)<br /><br /><span class="comment highlight">Verify
that this is the product used and installed, versus commercial product

"The Zoomify Viewers are used to view images that have been converted
for zoom-and-pan viewing. The Viewers are used in published form as
Flash movie 'SWF' files. In this form the Viewers [except for the
extra-functionality 'Annotation Viewer'] may be redistributed on
networks and distributable media. ... No Zoomify Viewer shall be
redistributed as part of a paid or free product with zoomable image
content created by any means other than a Zoomify converter obtained
with a licensed copy of a Zoomify product unless specifically permitted
by a written reseller agreement with Zoomify."<em><br />

2008-10-23: I have a personal license for the Zoomify runtime that
entitles me to redistribute it. I used this when consulting to the
museum, and I think it holds for the PAHMA deployment, but I doubt that
it holds for the Delphi project. Will have to straighten this out as
well. We may have to tell deployers to get the runtime from Zoomify
(they allow redist for any users).</span><br />

<h3>3.8. CSS (a technology for styling web pages)</h3>
<p><em>Description:&nbsp;</em> Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) are a technology, rather than a product: a specification
from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp; CSS makes it
possible to specify text fonts and styles, colors, layout positioning,
and other presentation aspects of Web pages. &nbsp;These are
specified by a set of appearance and layout definitions ("selectors"),
typically contained in separate files called "stylesheets," that can be
selectively applied to specific
parts of web pages.<br />
<br />
Support for CSS is built into all modern web
browsers.&nbsp; There are some variances in support for CSS
features, as well as in the rendering of Web pages based on various CSS
features, in
different Web browsers.&nbsp; However, over time, there has been a
trend toward more uniform support for CSS within modern web browsers.<span class="comment highlight"></span><br />
<em><br />
Use in Delphi</em>:&nbsp; CSS is used to specify the text
fonts and styles, colors, layout position, and other presentation
aspects of the collection browser's Web pages.</p>
<p>The HTML output generated by Delphi's collections browser, via
Smarty templates, does not contain information about how it will be
displayed on a web page.&nbsp; Rather, it contains 'decorations,'
such as the "class" and "id" attributes that uniquely identify various
HTML elements, that allow those elements to be styled, colored, and
positioned on the page through the use of CSS stylesheets.<br />
<br />
A great many aspects of the presentation of the collections
browser's web pages can be customized simply by changing styles in CSS
stylesheets, along with replacing static image files.&nbsp;
However, more significant customization, such as major changes to the
format of the lists of
results returned from searching or browsing, will also require
changes to one or more of Delphi's Smarty templates.
</p>
<p><em>Obtained from</em>:&nbsp; As a technology,
CSS is documented at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/</a></p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">The
collections browser currently uses a single large CSS file, style.css.</span></p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Opportunities
to parameterize the CSS file(s), for instance to allow one or more
theme colors to be provided externally, rather than being hard-coded as
values in the stylesheet.</span><br />
