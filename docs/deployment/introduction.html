<h1>Deploying Delphi: Introduction</h1>
<p>
This is an overview of the deployment of Delphi, an open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions.</p>
<p>
Delphi uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.</p>
<p>
To learn more about Delphi, see Delphi: Bibliography.
</p>
<p>
This deployment overview serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To document the current prototype instance of Delphi, in
production use at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>To make it easier to deploy and run your own instance of
Delphi, at an institution other than PAHMA.</li>
</ul>
