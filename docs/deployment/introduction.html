<h1>Deploying Delphi: Introduction</h1>
<div class="draftnote">
<p>This is a draft page, in ongoing development. It is still
rough, but we are exposing it to the community
for review and to help anyone considering a Delphi deployment. We are
actively updating all of the documentation, so it is best to use this
resource online, rather than printing out a version.</p>
</div>
<p>
This is an introduction to and overview of the deployment of Delphi, an open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions.</p>
<p>
Delphi uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.</p>
<p>
To learn more about Delphi, see <a href="../bibliography.html">Delphi
-
Bibliography</a> (TBD).
</p>
<p>
This deployment overview serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To document the current prototype instance of Delphi, in
production use at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>To make it easier to deploy and run your own instance of
Delphi, at an institution other than PAHMA.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment components</h2>
<p>There are three major components to the current Delphi
deployment used by the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley. &nbsp;These
components, along with their associated
sub-components, will also be present in any
highly similar instances of Delphi that are deployed and run outside
PAHMA:</p>
<strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>T</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">he Delphi "collections browser,"</span>
a web-based application, allows virtual museum visitors to explore
the museum's collections over
the Internet.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>A data repository</strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> stores the data that
is&nbsp;accessed by the collections browser.<br />
<br />
This includes </span>data about the
artifacts in the collections ("metadata"), plus a "semantic index"
containing the associations between each artifact and the set of
concepts that pertain to it.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>A set of back-end tools</strong>
process the data obtained from the museum, and load the data into the
data repository.<br />
</li>
</ul>
More detail about each of these three major components follows:
<h3>Collections browser<br />
</h3>
<p>The Delphi "collections browser," a web-based
application,&nbsp;allows virtual museum visitors to explore the
museum's collections over
the web.&nbsp; Visitors can search for artifacts, via both concepts
and keywords, and can interactively browse their various "facets" (e.g.
location, culture, materials).</p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">Decide
whether, and if so how, to introduce the personal annotation and
community curation aspects of Delphi here.</span></p>
<p>The collections browser currently runs
in the Apache Web Server and at its core consists of PHP-driven content
and template files, supported by PHP libraries; JavaScript code and
libraries; CSS style sheets, and a Flash-based tool to allow users to
zoom-and-pan through images.<br />
</p>
<p>To learn more about the collections, see <a href="collections-browser.html">Deploying Delphi:
Collections Browser</a>.</p>
<h3>Data repository</h3>
<p>The data repository contains the data that is accessed by the
collections browser. &nbsp;This data is also sometimes used for
reporting and other
purposes.<br />
<br />
Currently, the data repository is a MySQL relational
database. &nbsp;Delphi can also potentially use other relational
database software, or in the future, a "triple store" or other type of
database-like repository. <br />
<br />
The data repository stores two types of data:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Data about
artifacts in the collections ("metadata").<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Purposes of this data</span>:
&nbsp;This data is displayed when the Delphi collections browser
provides details about individual artifacts.<br />
<br />
In
addition, this data is "mined," via natural language processing, to
help build a set of concepts that more fully describe the collection
and then to associate those concepts with each of the individual
artifacts in the collections.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Source of this data</span>:
&nbsp;In the instance of Delphi used by PAHMA, this metadata comes
directly from that museum. &nbsp;Future instances of Delphi at
other
sites will obtain this data from their own museums or heritage
institutions. &nbsp;The format of this data will vary, depending on
how
the museum or heritage institution stores the met about its collections.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Data about the concepts associated with these artifacts (a
"semantic index").<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Purpose of this data</span>:
&nbsp;This data helps users of Delphi's collections browser locate
artifacts by concepts, and help uncover relationships between artifacts.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Source of this data</span>:
This data is generated by Delphi's back-end tools (below), based on the
data provided by the museum. &nbsp; &nbsp;Future instances of
Delphi at
other sites will build their own ontologies.</li>
</ul>
To learn more about the data repository, see <a href="data-repository.html">Deploying Delphi: Data Repository</a>.
<h3>Back-end tools</h3>
A set of back-end tools are used to take the data received from
PAHMA, process that data, and load it into the data repository.<br />
<p>There are currently two back-end tools:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>A 'sed' script for initial cleanup of the data.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>A Java-based, GUI application for further processing of the
cleaned
data.<br />
<br />
This application provides support for text analysis, semantic
indexing, and related support to build and maintain the database that
supports the online browser. &nbsp;Delphi's administrators and
others to
analyze and process data about the artifacts in the collection - both
metadata and semantic index data - and to load this data into the data
repository.<br />
<br />
<span class="comment highlight">The above paragraph
needs rewriting for clarity, and to merge similar ideas found in both
of its sentences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently,
these tools are used manually, in batch mode. &nbsp;Each of the
back-end
processes must also be run in a specific sequence, one after
another.&nbsp;
Future Delphi enhancements
may automate some of these back-end processes.</p>
<p>

<h2>Other Delphi
components</h2>
<p>In addition to the
three deployment-related components listed
above, there are two closely-related support components of the Delphi
project:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The code
repository
for the project</span>,
where its source code, templates,
configuration
files, libraries, and other files are stored, and its issues are
tracked.<br />
<br />
For more information about the code repository, see <a href="../code-repository.html">Delphi: Code Repository</a>.<br />
<br />
For a related discussion
of the hierarchical organization of the code and other artifacts for
the Delphi project, see <a href="../code-layout.html">Delphi:
Code Layout</a>.<br />
