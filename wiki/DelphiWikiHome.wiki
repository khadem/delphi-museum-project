= Project History and Heritage =

The Delphi project began as a large [http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi Masters' final project] at the U.C. Berkeley [http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/ School of Information]. In this phase the original project team conducted extensive needs assessment and usability studies for the collections browser functionality, developed the core NLP tools, helped the museum staff develop the faceted ontology, and built an alpha deployment of the collections browser for the [http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/ Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology].

A second phase of the PAHMA deployment ensued as the Museum reviewed the deployment internally and contracted Jon Lesser to do a visual re-design of the site. At the same time, Patrick Schmitz was hired by the [http://ist.berkeley.edu/ds IST/Data Services] group at U.C. Berkeley and IST/DS took over hosting and support of project. After a private beta in which Native American Tribal representatives reviewed and commented on the site, the initial deployment went live (at http://pahma.berkeley.edu/delphi/) and we presented the project at [http://www.archimuse.com/mw2008/papers/schmitz/schmitz.html Museums and the Web 2008].

= Documentation =

Documentation for the system is in active development, and is getting much better.  As introductory background, the MW2008 paper and the project report linked to above have quite a bit of discussion about the model and the procedures. 

For information about the deployment model followed for PAHMA, see [http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/deployment/introduction.html Deploying Delphi: Introduction].

For information about the code structure, libraries used, etc., see [http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/code-layout.html Delphi: Code Layout].

An important document to read describes [http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontologies/schema_notes.htm the basic ontology model, principles, and syntax].

= Current Plans =

Our current priorities for the project are:
  * Support the [http://pahma.berkeley.edu/delphi PAHMA deployment] (managed separately)
  * Support additional deployments and related development (including [http://code.google.com/p/concur-services/wiki/Home CONCUR])
  * Improve project and tools [http://delphi-museum-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/deployment/introduction.html documentation].
  * Address significant [ToolsUsabilityAndWorkflow usability and workflow issues for the back-end tools].
  * Extend features, fix bugs - see also the [http://code.google.com/p/delphi-museum-project/issues/list Issues list].
  * Gather feedback from users to refine usability, etc.

= Related Projects =

We are also working on some related projects that support this kind of work. As part of a larger initiative to provide [http://inews.berkeley.edu/articles/Spring2008/1185.html semantic services] at U.C. Berkeley, we are developing tools to support the community maintenance of curated resources. The CONCUR project will develop these tools, following a model described in [http://www.ludicrum.org/plsWork/papers/docEng08-schmitz.pdf a recent paper]. The first application of this framework will support ontology development by the PAHMA staff and research community.
