#Talk at VU and follow-up meeting

I (Patrick) gave a talk about Delphi (largely based upon the presentation for our [http://www.archimuse.com/mw2008/papers/schmitz/schmitz.html MW2008 paper] )and the CONCUR project to a group of AI and museum informatics types at the [http://www.vu.nl Vrije Universiteit(VU)] in Amsterdam. The talk skimmed over Delphi and the internals of that system, along with some information about CONCUR. It seemed to be well-received. There were plenty of questions and comments, and even the hard-core semantics folks said nice things and asked to keep in touch on CONCUR. 

Afterwards, I met with [http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jrvosse/ Jacco can Ossenbruggen], [http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/ Guus Schreiber], [http://www.cs.vu.nl/~laroyo/ Lora Aroyo] and [http://www.cs.vu.nl/~atordai/ Anna Tordai]. Although they are interested in the shallow NLP and ontology maintenance work, we ended up talking about collaborating on the [http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/collectionspace/CollectionSpace CollectionSpace project].
