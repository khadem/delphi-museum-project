Notes on TechniqueDesignDecoration Facet

General
note that noiseToken and reduce, used in this facet,
 are ignored in the current implementation
and may not be supported in the future (Patrick says that functionality
is likely to be moved to the code that pulls data from the DB)

Consistency Issues

Fruit and Vegetables is partly plural vs. Flower, Leaf, Tree
Posture or Attitude singular vs. Human Shapes, Animal Shapes, Plant Shapes

Capitalization of or in heading titles: Bobcat Or Lynx, Carved Or Shaped
vs Rabbit or Hare, etc. (or generally lowercase in heading titles)

Other
Performed, Sung, Spoken, Recorded, Filmed, Photographed, Taped, Written:
	should these be activities?

Weird Headings

BoxOrCube as heading title (Box or Cube? also noMatch?)
BlackFigureWare as heading title

4. Inference
No implies used

5. Get rid of synonyms that are the same as their headings
None are the same but see issues below

Headings also in ObjectName
Ammunition is heading under Symbolic and also in ObjectName
(and also synonym in ObjectName, I think)
Arrowhead
Cross
Mandala
Barrel
Cast (with synonym Casts = Casts in ObjectName with synonym Cast)

Synonyms that are headings or Synonyms in ObjectName
flute: synonym of tubular; Flute is also heading in ObjectName
	(use implies from ObjectName?)
Hoop
Casts
Castings
Mold
Molds

God: cf. God Symbol in ObjectName

7. Locations that are homonyms of terms in other facets
N/A

8. NoMatch / asToken issues

Headings used for Grouping (add noMatch=true?)

Technique or Manufacture
Greek Pottery Styles
Southwest Pottery Types
Beaded, Sequined, etc.
Carved Or Shaped (lowercase "or")
Casted or Molded

Duplicate tokens
eskimo (under HumanShapes)

Duplicate synonym
representation (under FigurativeOrRrepresentational)

Headings and Synonyms overlap (use noMatch for headings?)

Concave-Convex (noMatch?)
Crescent (is synonym crescent shaped needed?)
Lentoid (lens-shaped): has synonyms lentoid and lens-shaped
Piriform (pear-shaped): has synonyms Piriform and pear-shaped
Ring, Hoop or Crown (noMatch?)
Toroid (Donut-shaped)

9. Headings/tokens combine with prefixes and suffixes. Synonyms do not
Difference appears to be observed

10. Plurals must be made synonyms

Walrus (will correct plural be added?)
