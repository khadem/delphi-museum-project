<h1>Deploying Delphi: Back-end Tools</h1>
<div class="draftnote">
<p>This is a draft page, in ongoing development. It is still
rough, but we are exposing it to the community
for review and to help anyone considering a Delphi deployment. We are
actively updating all of the documentation, so it is best to use this
resource online, rather than printing out a version.</p>
</div>
<br />
<span class="comment highlight">NOTE: This is a
placeholder
document at present, and is extremely rough - consisting of a set of
un-connected notes, which are also known to have many inaccuracies and
omissions, as well as numerous overlapping repetitions of content.<br />
<br />
All of the content below the horizontal line, below should be assumed
to be unfinished and not to be relied upon.</span><br />
<p>This is an overview of the back-end tools in Delphi, an
open source
software system that helps open up access via the Web to collections of
artifacts held by museums, historical societies, archeological
repositories and similar heritage institutions. &nbsp;Delphi uses
artificial intelligence and natural language processing to
make it more effective and enjoyable to find individual artifacts in
collections, and to uncover relationships between artifacts, than is
possible through traditional searching and browsing.</p>
<p>The
Delphi Project includes several back-end tools for analyzing and
processing data about the artifacts in an institution's
collections, and loading this data into a data repository. &nbsp;Using
a Java-based application, Delphi's administrators perform a set of
tasks in a specific sequence in order to process the data and load it
into the data repository.&nbsp;At a specific point in the process, they also use a collection of 'sed' scripts are to clean up selected data.&nbsp; </p><p>Currently, these back-end tools must be used manually, in batch
mode. &nbsp;Future Delphi enhancements
may help automate some of this work.<br /></p><h2>Java-based application</h2><p>The primary back-end tool is a Java-based, menu-driven
application. &nbsp;By selecting various menu options in this application, Delphi administrator's can
perform the tasks necessary to prepare the three types of data used by Delphi's collections browser:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concepts that describe the collections ("ontology").<br /><br />The
first set of tasks involves creating and iteratively refining a set of
concepts that describe the collections. &nbsp;This builds a "mental
model" of the collections, formally called an "ontology."<br />
<br />The ontology is currently built and maintained by Delphi's
administrators, working closely with the staff of the museum or other
institution. &nbsp;It consists of broad conceptual categories, or
"facets," each containing a hierarchical "tree" of more specific
concepts.<br /><br />For instance, for the instance of Delphi for
the&nbsp;Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)
at the University of California, Berkeley, facets describing the
collections include "Location," "Cultural Group", and "Technique,
Design or Decoration." &nbsp;Examples of hierarchically nested concepts
that fall within the "Location" facet include "United States,"
"Southwestern states," "California," and "Madera county."<br /><br /> Currently, the ontology consists of a set of XML files, one for each facet.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Data about the
artifacts in the collections ("metadata").<br />
<br />The second set of tasks involves retrieving and organizing the
data about the artifacts in the collections, formally known as "metadata."<br /><br />This
metadata comes from the museum or other heritage
institution, usually from their collections management system or
catalog of the collections. &nbsp;It typically consists of the text and
numeric fields describing the artifacts in the collection, such as the
titles, descriptions, and ID numbers for each artifact. &nbsp;Media,
such as digital photos or scans, are a second type of metadata that
further describes the artifacts.<br /><br />In
the instance of Delphi for PAHMA, this data is currently obtained as a
comma-separated value (CSV) text dump from the museum, along with a set
of digital images. &nbsp;After selecting and cleaning up the text-based
metadata, it is loaded into Delphi's data repository, and the digital
images are stored in a filesystem.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Associations between concepts and artifacts ("semantic index").<br /><br />The
third set of tasks involves making connections between the two types of
data created above: associating concepts from the ontology with the
artifacts in the collections, thus creating what is formally termed a
"semantic index."<br /><br />In the instance of Delphi for PAHMA, these
associations are currently generated by Delphi's administrators, with
the involvement of the museum's staff in improving the quality of this
work over time. &nbsp;Through this process, a Native American basket
might, for instance, be associated
- either explicitly or through hierarchy - with a set of
concepts:&nbsp;"United States," "Southwestern states," "California,"
"Inyo county," "Death Valley" and "McKinley" in the Location
facet; "North American Indian Cultures", "California Tribes,"
"Shoshone," and "Panamint" in the Cultural Group facet; and "Figurative
or Representational", "Insects," and "Butterfly," as well as "Carved or
Shaped" and "Coiled" in the Technique, Design and Decoration facet.
&nbsp;The semantic index makes it possible for the collections browser
to return this basket when a user of the Delphi collection browser
searches or browses by concepts like "Southwestern states and
butterfly", as well as helping them explore its
relationship to other artifacts in the collections. <span class="comment highlight"></span><br /><br />
This
matching of data about an artifact to one or more concepts in the
ontology is
performed by sifting through ("mining") text in the artifact's
metadata. &nbsp;Specifically, various natural language processing techniques are
applied to find words or multi-word phrases in the metadata that match concepts - or their synonyms -
in the ontology. &nbsp;These associations between concepts and artifacts are then stored in Delphi's data repository.<br />
</li>
</ol><h2>'sed' scripts<br /></h2><p>There is also a secondary but nonetheless important back-end
tool, comprised of <span style="font-weight: bold;">a collection of 'sed' scripts</span>.
&nbsp;These scripts are used to perform an initial cleanup of the metadata about the artifacts in the collections that is
received from
the museum or other heritage institution, before that metadata is processed by
the Java-based application.<br /><br />In
the case of data
received from PAHMA,
for instance,&nbsp;data that must be cleaned up by these scripts
include internal
notes that
are likely of interest only to museum staff; potentially sensitive
notations about donors or purchase prices; and 'garbage' characters
that can make it difficult to mine the text in the metadata to find
associated concepts.</p>
<hr /><br />
The
goal of this processing and analysis is to build a "semantic index,"
which associates a set of concepts from a mental model ("ontology")
with each artifact. &nbsp;That way, the collection can be searched
or
browsed by these concepts - such as culture, use or context, material,
and design - in addition to the data ("metadata") already available for
the artifact.<br />
<br />
These back-end tools are used to carry out the following processes, all
of which are necessary to build the semantic index:<br />
<br />
<span class="comment highlight">This is a rough
placeholder for now.</span><br />
<ol>
<li>Retrieving data ("metadata") from the collection(s).<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Cleaning up the data.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Merging data.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Building and maintaining the mental model ("ontology").<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Associating concepts from that model with each artifact.</li>
</ol>
<p>The
following notes are specific to the instance of Delphi for the Phoebe
A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA) at the University of
California, Berkeley. However, highly similar procedures would need to
be carried out with new instances of Delphi that may be applied to
collections at other institutions.</p>
<h2>1. Retrieving data from the collections</h2>
To kick-off its set of back-end processes, Delphi's back-end tools need
to first retrieve data ("metadata") from PAHMA about the artifacts in
the collection.<br />
<br />
PAHMA stores data about the artifacts in its collections in a content
management system, <a href="http://www.gallerysystems.com/products/tms.html" target="_blank">The Museum System</a> (TMS) by Gallery
Systems (http://www.gallerysystems.com/products/tms.html).
&nbsp;TMS uses Microsoft SQL Server as a back-end
relational database management system.<br />
<br />
At one point in the
past, PAHMA staff determined which of the approximately 250 database
tables used by TMS have pertinent data about their artifacts.
&nbsp;Via SQL queries, they periodically extract that data into
comma-separated value (CSV) files, in order to make this data available
to Delphi. &nbsp;These CSV files are structured as a set of named
columns, each
containing text annotations about the artifacts.<br />
<br />
On certain occasions, Delphi's administrators physically visit PAHMA to
acquire
PAHMA's latest extracts from the TMS database, placing them on a memory
stick or similar portable drive.<br />
<br />
As of Fall 2008, &nbsp;the entire database extract - about 1
million database table rows, representing some 600 million artifacts in
the collection, and requiring about 250 MB of disk space (uncompressed)
or 30 MB (compressed) &#8211; is processed each time.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Notes regarding possible
future enhancements:</span><br />
<br style="font-style: italic;" />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Directly access database
data from PAHMA</span>. &nbsp;Beginning in Fall 2008,
Delphi's administrators have been working with PAHMA staff to determine
whether it is feasible for Delphi to perform the same SQL queries
directly against the TMS database over the campus network.
&nbsp;This could obviate the need for physical visits, making it
possible to both automate some of the back-end processing workflows and
to perform them more frequently.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Create a data warehouse</span>.
&nbsp;In addition, IST's MySQL Basic service allows the creation of
multiple databases. &nbsp;This may make it feasible to set up a
"data warehouse," a database dedicated to storing newly-received data
from PAHMA, and replace the current practice of storing and
manipulating text extracts from PAHMA's TMS databases. &nbsp;Future
back-end tools could directly extract data from the data warehouse, in
more automated workflows that could then selectively update the data in
Delphi's production database.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Process only updated
data, rather than all data at once</span>. &nbsp;A future
goal
of the Delphi Project is to make it possible to identify just what has
changed between successive processing runs &#8211; additions, changes, and
deletions taking place after the previous run &#8211; and process just that
data. A data warehouse or, barring that, some other changes in
practices, might make that more feasible.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Other notes</span>:<br />
<br />
TMS was designed for art collections, not anthropology collections.
&nbsp;As a result, there are some ideosyncracies in the way that
data is stored in TMS's database tables that need to be worked around.
&nbsp;For instance, with artwork, typically the location field is
used to specify where the artifact is currently located. &nbsp;With
anthropology collections, a second location value also needs to be
provided, identifying the setting in which the artifact was originally
found.<br />
<br />
Also, because of some programming quirks in TMS, pertinent data may be
stored in any number of tables and fields. &nbsp;For instance,
there are six possible places where location data for an artifact may
be stored.<br />

<h2>2. Cleaning up the data</h2>
The data that comes in from PAHMA requires some cleanup before it can
be provided for public access via Delphi's collections browser.
<br />
<br />
(Background - may not be necessary to discuss this here ...) The
characteristics of this data vary throughout the
collections, making this cleanup necessary. &nbsp;Annotations about
the objects in PAHMA's collections have been made by many different
people, over a period of more than a century, and in recent years some
of this data was imported from a variety of data repositories, each
with their own ideosyncracies.<br />
<br />
Patrick notes: "This is getting less important over time as the museum
cleans up some of their CMS metadata, but some of it is correct in the
CMS, but inappropriate for public viewing (such as prices of objects,
donor names, etc.)."<br />
<br />
There are several types of&nbsp;problematic data that must be
cleaned:
<ul>
<li>Noise data.<br />
<br />
Generally this is internal data, of interest primarily to institutional
staff, rather than to the public. &nbsp;While
valuable in its own right, this data does not describe the
characteristics of an artifact and therefore is not
useful in associating concepts with that artifact.<br />
<br />
Examples
include notations about an artifact having been examined by a
particular anthropologist or other expert, or reviewed by a committee.
&nbsp;Attribution notes, tracking notes or notations for accounting
review are other representative examples.<br />
<br />
Noise data is generally removed outright ("elided"), in a process
generically termed "noise reduction."<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Confidential or sensitive data.<br />
<br />
This includes prices paid for objects, detailed storage locations and
donor names.<br />
<br />
Confidential or sensitive data is generally either obfuscated or
anonymized - for instance, prices are
obfuscated with placeholder values like&nbsp;<code>$##.##</code>
or&nbsp;<code>&#8364;##.##</code> - so that
sentence structures can remain intact.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Problematic character data.<br />
<br />
Characters pasted in from Word, for instance, that are in various
character sets. &nbsp;'Smart' (curly) quote marks, em- and
en-dashes, and ... &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Problematic character data is generally encoded as XML entities.
&nbsp;*VERIFY THIS*<br />
<br />
(Placeholder)
Note that some XML entities need to be further transformed within PHP,
when preparing data for output on web pages, to avoid various display
issues.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performing the cleanup</h3>
This cleanup is currently performed
using one or more 'sed' scripts on Patrick's workstation. &nbsp;sed
is
a text processing tool that includes the ability to use regular
expressions patterns to transform text. &nbsp;It comes standard
with
Unix-like systems&nbsp;, and is available for other operating
systems.
&nbsp;For more background on sed, please see this&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article</a> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed).<br />
<br />
Most
of the processing performed by these scripts uses either of two
types of regular expression rules: finding and replacing text, or
deleting any text if a match is found (as is done with noise data).
&nbsp;These rules have been commented, both to describe their
purpose
and to summarize what text substitutions or deletions they are
performing.<br />
<br />
Due to the
potential sensitivity of their contents, these sed scripts are not
currently managed under version control, nor are there copies in the
'pahma' account on the IST Unix Web Farm.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">To do note</span>:
At Patrick's suggestion, Aron will look into whether these scripts
might be
securely stored in the Subversion repository associated with that IST
Unix Web Farm account. &nbsp;Although that repository is primarily
intended for migrations between Web Farm tiers, it could also be used
for an auxiliary purpose like this.
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Notes regarding possible
future enhancements:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Use a rules processing
engine, along with a configuration
file</span>:&nbsp; Patrick Schmitz has suggested that the
cleanup process
could be made more general and configurable <br />
<br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/delphi-museum-project/wiki/DataImportNotes" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/delphi-museum-project/wiki/DataImportNotes</a><br />
<br />
Question to self: Does the cleanup process also involve tokenizing the
data, or is this a separate step? &nbsp;See Patrick's
"Documentation Needs" notes.<br />
<br />
<h2>3. Merging data</h2>
Merging data from multiple database dump files (a "dump set") into a
single dump file.<br />
<br />
Handling duplicate records for certain artifacts. &nbsp;Likely done
simply by sorting (?), and code then handles contiguous records with
identical IDs.<br />

<p><em>Description</em>: A set of back-end tools are
provided for processing and analyzing data about the artifacts in the
collection, and to load this data into a data repository.&nbsp;
These tools are used behind the scenes, rather than being directly
accessible to virtual museum visitors.</p>
<p><em>Use in Delphi</em>: These back-end tools are
used primarily to prepare data for access by the web-based collections
browser.</p>
<p>This data is also used for other purposes, as well.&nbsp;
For instance, it is used to generate reports for museum staff, IT
personnel, and researchers: to help them better understand the
collection, find and correct errors in cataloging, and iteratively
improve Delphi's natural language processing, among other purposes.*</p>
<p>Currently, extracts of data from the museum's collections
management system are created, at various intervals, by PAHMA
staff.&nbsp; These extracts to date have typically consisted of
between one and eight separate files.</p>
<p>This data is then provided to Delphi's administrators, who
process the data using these back-end tools.&nbsp; These tools must
be run manually - in batch mode - and in a particular
sequence.&nbsp; A Java-based GUI application, MainApp, provides a
unified control panel for many of these tools; its menu options provide
some guidance for what steps must be performed, and in what
order.&nbsp; Some other tools are run separately, outside of
MainApp.&nbsp; A proposed future enhancement to Delphi is to
automate many parts of this back-end workflow.</p>
<p>As an abstract, high-level overview, these back-end tools
perform the following tasks (*VERIFY THIS -&nbsp; THIS HAS BEEN
WRITTEN AS A PLACEHOLDER WITHOUT REFERENCING ANY DOCUMENTATION*)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Cleaning up" the data ("metadata") for each of the
artifacts in the collection.
<p>Examples of clean-up include removing "sensitive, stale or
otherwise undesired noise" from the metadata.&nbsp; For instance,
sensitive data, such as donor names and the prices of artifacts, need
to be removed before this data can be stored in the data repository.</p>
<p>It's also helpful to be clear about what Delphi's cleanup
work <em>doesn't</em> attempt to do.&nbsp; When many
different people enter data about the artifacts in a collection,
especially over a considerable period of time, there will inevitably be
considerable variance in this data.&nbsp; Sometimes, data entered
even for two highly similar artifacts can contain significant
differences.&nbsp; While sets of terms ("controlled vocabularies")
and other curatorial practices can reduce this variance, they can't
eliminate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delphi's back-end tools generally don't try to correct or
standardize metadata about artifacts, although Delphi's cleanup work
and its other back-end workflows can occasionally reveal specific
issues that can readily be addressed by curators.&nbsp; Rather,
they build new data that ...</p>
<p>... identify sets of terms, found in different data
fields, all of which may correspond to a particular concept or
sub-concept.&nbsp; This helps tie together sets of related
artifacts whose metadata wouldn't otherwise make clear their similarity.</p>
</li>
<li>Scanning this metadata and determining what concepts
("facets") in a previously-developed mental model ("ontology") apply to
each artifact.
<p>By associating concepts with artifacts, this allows
virtual museum visitors to more powerfully search and browse the
collections than is possible by searching or browsing the metadata
alone.&nbsp; This also helps museum staff, scholars, and others
better understand the collections and find emerging patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>Build and maintain the mental model ("ontology"),
independently of any data about artifacts.
<p>The mental model used in the instance of Delphi for PAHMA
is specific to the archeological artifacts in that museum's
collections.&nbsp; While it does contain many concepts that are
germane to many types of artifacts, when used with instances of Delphi
outside PAHMA this model will likely need to be changed.</p>
<p>In Delphi's back-end tools, the association between
concepts in the mental model, and text that appears in one or more of
the fields of the data ("metadata") for each of the artifacts in the
collection, is maintained as ... XML ...</p>
</li>
<li>Load the data - about the artifacts in the collection,
the
associations between artifacts and their associated concepts, and the
mental model that defines those concepts - into a data
repository.&nbsp; This allows the data to be flexibly accessed at
high speed.</li>

<em>Issues (very rough notes, needs cleanup, needs entry of
and/or references to bugs in Google Code)</em>:
<p><span class="comment highlight">The
Java-based application that provides access to various back-end modules
may be enabling certain menu options, that allow and/or guide work to
be performed out of sequence.</span></p>
<p><span class="comment highlight">It
would be desirable if updates to the data in the repository could occur
more frequently, to be more responsive to ongoing changes to the
museum's collections.&nbsp; This might require changes both in the
museum's processes and in the back-end tools and workflows.&nbsp;
For instance, the current load scripts wipe out ("drop"), recreate, and
reload database tables with new data, rather than performing a set of
inserts, updates, and deletions.</span></p>
