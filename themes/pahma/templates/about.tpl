<p><a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi">Delphi</a> is
a web-based collections browser created in 2007 by the students from
the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley School of Information</a> for the
<a href="http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/">Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology</a> 
at the University of California, Berkeley. The Museum's collections span the world and
document several thousand years of human culture and prehistory, yet only a tiny fraction
of the artifacts are exhibited due to limited Museum space. The Museum's current collections
management system contains roughly 615,000 records, which represent nearly all of the 
approximately 2 to 3 million objects in their collections. About 28,000 of these records 
have high-resolution images associated with them, and new images are added at the rate of
a few thousand each month.
</p>
<p>
The main goals of the Delphi project were to expose the vast collection on the web which 
is not limited by physical size constraints and to make its contents more accessible to
researchers, educators, and general public, while protecting the Museum's ownership rights
over the images. In addition to increasing the visibility of the Museum to a much larger
audience, we also wanted to emphasize the breadth of their collection which encompasses
a wide range of objects: from an ancient Egyptian sculpture from Giza to Japanese swords
to century-old photos of Native Californians. 
</p>
<p>Delphi can be used by researchers, students, and educators, though we decided to
design our system to accomodate the needs of the general public, which the Museum wants
to attract.  
</p>
<p>
Searching and browsing functionality could be used to explore the collections. The Delphi
facetted browser is based on an ontology designed from the metadata in the
Museum's current content management system. 
Delphi uses text-mining to associate ontology concepts with collections objects. 
Please read our <a href="../help/help.php">Help</a> section
to learn to browse and search the ontologies of objects presented by Delphi 
</p>
<p>
The Delphi user interface presents each object with descriptive metadata extracted from
the Museum's database and a zoom-and-pan explorer of high-resolution images.
It supports user-annotation of the collections where visitors can 1) tag and comment objects,
2) create and organize sets of objects of interest, and 3)
share their annotations and sets with others.
