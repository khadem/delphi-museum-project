<p>Delphi is an online browsing and searching system that can be used by
researchers, students, and educators to explore diverse museum collections. The
interface helps a user discover and understand &quot;what's there.&quot;
Delphi's features support searching, browsing, viewing information about
objects, creating and viewing sets of objects, and annotating objects in the
collections.
</p>

<p>Delphi was originally created 
at the University of California, Berkeley as a collaboration between students at
the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu"> School of Information</a> and staff
of the
<a href="http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/">Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology</a>.
The current deployment is supported by the University's <a href="http://ist.berkeley.edu/ds/">IST/Data
Services</a> group.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>The Delphi faceted browser provides a simple way to navigate through museum
collections. The browser view changes dynamically to show only categories
relevant to the area of the collection that is being explored. This makes the
browsing experience more visually streamlined and helps the visitor discover
categories and relationships between objects that may not otherwise be obvious.
Clicking on any category refines the search. The category listing is
derived automatically from an underlying ontology that organizes concepts
associated with the collections into distinct facets such as location, culture,
materials, etc. Concepts are associated to each object in the collections by
text mining - applying linguistic tools to text metadata from an existing
content management system.
</p>
<p>
The system is documented in the <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2007/delphi">original
project report</a>, and in a recent <a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2008/abstracts/prg_335001764.html">conference
paper</a>. Please read our <a href="{$wwwroot}/modules/help/help.php">Help</a> section
