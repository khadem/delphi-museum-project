Review of Culture Facet
Susan Stone, February 24, 2009 

General
We would like to be able to validate the full ontology against an XML schema.
This means extra note elements as used in the Culture facet can't be added
at will. Please move the following notes entirely into XML comments
(and please don't embed comments within comments; my tools are having
trouble with that).

FUTURE_REVISION_NOTES
temporary_notes
syntax_notes
note under California tribes betwen Patwin and Pomo

The schema allows one <description> under the taxonomy element in each facet,
followed by zero or one <notes>).

There are still many comments about dupes and revisions to make in this facet;
some of these concern things also listed below.

1. number of headings at a given node level (should be 3-12)

also check for weird titles

(3-letter cultures OK)
Long headings (may be OK; not sure how much room there is in GUI):

7. Locations: see above for duplicate headings/IDs

8. NoMatch, asToken:

headings used just for grouping:
xxx cultures, xxx tribes, locations (particularly location strings
that appear in the location facet) and regional headings: should these be
NoMatch="true"

9. Prefixes, suffixes: none

10.: Missing plurals: n.a.
